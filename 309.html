<p><b>[Score a T]</b></p>
<p>Knowing what must be done and hoping to make his death seem natural, you place a silken cushion over Ogedai's face and press down. His hands scrabble feebly at yours, but he is too weak to resist. The guards' wills seem to grow stronger, battling with yours, at the sight of you murdering their Khan. You must make another Power of Will Roll to see if you can maintain your control.</p>
<p>If you score 7-12, turn to 329 - If you score 2-6, turn to 317</p>
