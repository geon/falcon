<p>Your aim was true. A lancing white bolt of superheated plasma erupts against one of the guards. He is blown back against the end wall of the corridor and then slumps to the floor. The second guard runs off as two security droids arrive. You walk up to the fallen man after giving your Security Code to the hovering droids as they aim their stun-lasers at you. You identify yourself. Satisfied, they begin to hunt the second assassin. Your fallen assailant is dying, there is nothing you can do. You ask who sent him, and lean close to hear him gasp: 'Time Lord ...', but the rest is lost in a spasm of coughing as he dies. You head back to the safety of Falcon's Wing. Turn to 336.</p>
