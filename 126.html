<p>You win the battle of wills but the mental strain saps you. Lose 2 Endurance points. You can control Agent Bloodhound. You take him to Falcon's Wing and instruct him to examine CAIN's records. It soon becomes obvious to him that you are on a vitally important mission and that his mission to kill you must be abandoned. You release him from your control and Bloodhound says, 'I'm sorry, Falcon, someone has used me, someone who wants the timelines to be changed.'</p>
<p>'Who gave you the order to kill me?' you ask.</p>
<p>'Our Section Chief, Agidy Yelov,' he replies. 'He told me you had killed Lord Kirik.'</p>
<p>'But Kirik has only been dead a matter of minutes,' you tell him.</p>
<p>Bloodhound pauses then says, 'Yes, of course, Falcon, how can he know of Kirik's death so soon? Either he was responsible or he is in league with the traitor that did it.' Your Section Chief is working with the Renegade Lord. Turn to 255.</p>
