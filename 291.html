<p>The nearest mongol slides from his horse, but the others are upon you before you can do anything. A viciously hooked lance embeds itself in your chest and you cannot dodge their swords. They make your death as slow as possible, but you are already losing blood fast from several wounds. You are thankful when death takes you, but, as Falcon, you have failed.</p>
