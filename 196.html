<p>You lie down in the Autodoc and the anaesthetising pad which rests over a small vein in your neck sends you into unconsciousness. You never come round again. The course of the past will be changed too soon after you would have left the Autodoc for you to prevent it. While Falcon's Wing lies idle at the Eiger Vault an evil intelligence has been at work. You have failed.</p>
