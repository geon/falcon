<p><b>[Score a C]</b></p>
<p>At this range you cannot miss and your blast overloads the cydroid's infra-red sensory circuits, leaving it temporarily inert. You step behind it and find the removable disc below which lies the de-activation switch. When you have thrown the switch you examine the cydroid carefully. It appears to be a very advanced model, equipped with a Particle Disrupter. Of particular interest is the serial number above the de-activation switch, SAT 17YV. Record this serial number on your Agent Profile sheet. Leaving the cydroid, you move on to the hovrail embarkation point. Turn to 169.</p>
