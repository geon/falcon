A third of the land's surface is populated with cities which stretch miles up towards the Ionosphere and are also tunnelled deep into the Earth's crust.
The world is united - war within the atmosphere of a single planet can only lead to total destruction. Government is carried out by Executives, each having full powers within a certain area. The Food, Health, Pleasure and Enforcement Executives are centred in Alpolis, a city covering what was once an independent country - Switzerland - and it is here that the most recent Executive, TIME, exists.
People live for fun, not to work. Most tasks are performed by robots, so life is quite easy. Only 10% of the population still works, and then only for fun or out of a sense of social duty. Food is plentiful, the main source being a fungus grown in huge vats under artificial light. Luxury foods, such as meat, are a rarity. Communications have improved so as to transform society: holophones connect all homes across the Space Federation so it is possible to be in direct contact with many alien species light years across space. Travel on earth is done by hovrail, jetcopter or stratocruiser, so that the longest journey need take no more than an hour.
The average Earther lives for two hundred and fifty years and the ageing process only begins during the last fifty years of life. Life-prolonging drugs, called Anagathics, are freely available, and transplant surgery is now a simple operation. Unfortun- ately, because people live longer, there are many problems. There is overcrowding and very little to do which has resulted in a rapid increase in violent crime. With so many people needing new hearts, lungs and other organs there is a shortage of spare parts for use in transplant surgery, so the Enforcement Executive has passed a Termination Code. All violent crimes are punishable by painless death. The Enforcement Executive has had sensors set up to catch criminals, especially Bodybrokers who deal illegally in organs for surgery. If Energy Weapons are used by criminals, for instance, a police jetcopter will be there in seconds.

 Earth,using Hyperdrive, faster-than-light travel, has estab- lished itself as head of the Space Federation, which includes all the earth colonies and alien planets. The Navy patrols the colonies: Lastlanding, Proxima Centauri, Ascension and so on, as well as the alien worlds: Kelados, Sundew, Dyskra, Clyss, Rigel Prime, the Hive and others. Contact with alien life forms is commonplace and the colony ships of the twenty-fourth century are still approaching the centre of the galaxy.
How to Travel in Time
Travel through time involves crossing a fourth dimension, 'Null-space' or the 'Void' as it is known. This dimension joins all points in time and space from the beginning of the universe to its end. Imagine time as a cable. Earth's Timeline (or past, present and future) is a single strand of this cable stretching from Earth's beginning to the end of time. The Timelines of other planets run alongside this and weave around each other, because events on one planet affect things on another. These strands, or Timelines, are insulated from the fourth dimension in the same way that an electrical wire is insulated. At certain points there are holes in the insulation allowing travel from one point on the wire through this hole to a different point on this or another wire. In this way a Time Machine may move from one 'Timehole' to another and from one point in space to another via Null-space.
The Timeholes are formed when the fabric of time is damaged by unknown forces. They can be larger, but are usually less than five miles across. Timeholes come and go as new damage occurs and older Timeholes close up naturally. The Monitoring Section is responsible for keeping the map of current Timeholes. Your up-to-date map is at the beginning of the book. At least one hole has been there for a long time - the Eiger Vault, near the TIME Building in the Alps. It is thought to be a permanent Timehole and your Time Machine, Falcon's Wing, is kept there along with those of the Lords of TIME and other Agents. Some Timeholes are safer than others and it is possible to go back in time only to find that the hole through which you travelled has closed up, trapping the unfortunate traveller in the past. Time passes at the same rate in all Timeholes as on Earth. If you begin a journey to a Timehole ten minutes after somebody else does you will arrive ten minutes later than them. Only those with Psychic Awareness can navigate across Null-space.

SCORING
You will notice as you use this book that certain paragraph numbers are followed by a letter in brackets. If you wish to score your performance as Special Agent Falcon, you will need to make a list of the letters following these numbers on the box provided on your Agent Profile every time you come to one of these paragraphs. If you should be killed or fail in your adventure, you should delete your current recorded letters except for all the Qs which must be kept and begin again. Each letter corresponds to a score, and you will be given a rating, depending on what the total of your scores is. The letter scores may be found at the back of the second book of this series, Mechanon. This is necessary, since printing the scores in this book would allow you to find out what the right decisions to take in this adventure are!
Equipment
Standard Issue for TIME Special Agents
ITEM i: MODEL A3 TIME MACHINE [see accompanying speci-
fications]
Your own Time Machine, Falcon's Wing, is silver with bright scarlet markings and is the eleventh machine capable of travel through time ever built. Its cost cannot be computed, since it involves the use of certain materials and scientific skills which are priceless. The silver and scarlet hull will withstand enormous pressure, heat and exposure to harmful gasses and liquids, as .well as providing protection from radiation.
The six hydraulic legs which support the machine are extended when it materialises in a new Timehole, to provide stability on uneven ground. The Main Access is operated by invisible Tractor Beams (energy beams that can be used to grip and lift) that will draw the Time Traveller up into the cabin, to rest on the Access Disc. This disc is matter but is changed to air as you move through it by the Molecular Converter (see Item 4). The pressurised cabin is lined with instruments and gadgets. The crash couch is moulded to fit your shape and can be moved up to the command console or up into the Flyer (see Item 6).
In certain paragraphs you will have the chance to attack an enemy. When you choose to do so, you will be asked to make an Attack Roll. To do this, roll two dice and add the numbers together. You will be told which paragraph to turn to next, depending on your score. In all combats you are more likely to succeed if your score is high than if it is low
ATTACK MODIFIER
Whenever you make an Attack Roll you must add or subtract your Attack Modifier to the dice score. Your Attack Modifier may change as the adventure unfolds and you should keep a note of this on your Agent Profile (at beginning of adventure). To begin with your Attack Modifier is zero.
EV ASION
In certain cases you may need to avoid the attack of an enemy or escape from a difficult situation. You will be asked to make an Evasion Roll, to which you must add or subtract your Evasion Modifier. This works in the same way as the Attack Roll and
POWERS OF THE MIND
Some paragraphs will offer you the chance to make a mental attack, either a Thinkstrike or Power of Will. Make an Attack Roll, just as if you were attacking normally, but add or subtract your Thinkstrike or Power of Will Modifier, not your Attack Modifier. In all other ways mental attacks work in the same way as a physical attack. To begin with your Thinkstrike and Power of Will Modifiers are zero, as noted on your Agent Profile.

You, Falcon, start the adventure with 20 points of Endurance. If you are wounded in combat, suffer something unpleasant such as an acid atmosphere without a space suit, or become exhausted, you will lose Endurance points.

TIME MACHINE
TIME MACHINE
  
The air inside the machine is kept pure by the life support unit and can be flushed out and replaced within ten seconds. The Main Access will work only when its Memory Scanner recognises your own brain patterns. Specially sensitive cameras and power floodlights are mounted on top of the Machine. The Variac Drive, which forces the Machine into null-space, is housed beneath the deck and is controlled through your computer (CAIN, see Item 7).
ITEM 2: HOLOGRAM GENERATOR
Each Time Machine is equipped with a Hologram Generator - very important if the First Law of TIME is to be obeyed. The Generator changes the appearance of the Machine by casting a hologram around it, so the computer can make the Machine look like a small wood, hayrick or grassy hill etc, which is very lifelike unless you are within two metres of the Machine itself. This stops people in history being curious at the sight of a highly technologicalmachine.
ITEM 3: HOLO-DETECTOR
Due to the existence of Hologram Generators you may find it difficult to see other Time Machines. As a member of the Time Police you have been given a Hologram-detector which is portable and operates to a range of fifty metres. This will reveal the presence of a hologram and therefore another Time Machine.
ITEM 4: MOLECULAR CONVERTOR
Each Time Machine is equipped with a Molecular Converter, a device which uses the rarest of all elements, Polybdenum, as its fuel. Small articles, placed in the Converter, are transformed into whatever the computer decides. In this way, Time Travellers have disguises which allow them to pass undetected amongst the intelligent beings of other times. CAIN, your computer, carries information about the Timeholes shown on your map, so that the blueprints required by the Converter to make the disguises accurate, are usually available. Your Psionic Helmet, for instance, can be turned into a legionary's helmet, while keeping its modern powers.
ITEM 5: AUTODOC [see accompanying specifications]
This is a couch-like device which has needles, a drip, a blood supply and surgical robo-arms. You may lie in the Autodoc
during the time taken to travel from one Timehole to another, for instance, and come out healed, restoring your Endurance by up to twelve points. You will be told when you can use your Autodoc.
ITEM6: FLYER [see accompanying specification]
Your crash-couch swivels up onto the platform of your flyer when you wish to use it. The flyer is a small hover-raft which is catapulted out of the Time Machine through the Launch Doors, two sections on top of the hull that slide apart. Once safely away from the Machine the Ion Drive can be cut in, giving the flyer a top speed many times the speed of sound (Mach 6). It can hover which allows you to use it as an observation platform, but it is too small to carry a Hologram Generator and should only be used when strictly necessary. Fortunately, its Ion Drive is almost soundless. You are also issued with a Homing Beacon, which, when activated, will make the flyer move to its location as quickly as possible. The flyer is then piloted by its micro computer. The Beacon is magnetic, and about the size of a die.
ITEM7: CAIN [Cybernetic Artificial Intelligence Nexus]
CAIN is one of the most advanced computers known to man. Its data banks offer information on all subjects and historical data on all Federation and alien planets. Its memory banks are continuously updated with information concerning the Time- holes and it is able to link with the massive memory banks of the TIME Service Computer at the Eiger Vault. A holophone, through which you can contact any other holophone in the Federation, is built into CAIN and you also have access to most of the files kept by TIME. CAIN answers to your spoken commands and runs the Time Machine for you. It can display information visually, via the terminal screen, or verbally, using its melodic chimes.
ITEM 8: BLASTER [see accompanying specifications]
This is your Standard Starship Trooper issue Plasma Pistol. It fires superheated plasma to a range of 100 metres, and the Energy Pack is sufficient for ten minutes continuous use. You have more Energy Packs in your weapons locker. Your blaster is labelled, 'For use in exceptional circumstances only'.
ITEM 9: PSIONIC ENHANCER [see accompanying specifications] This helmet helps your Powers of the Mind by damping all other

Personal Background
Special Agent (TIME)
Codename: Falcon
For three years you have studied at the Academy as a cadet attached to TIME: the Temporal, Investigative and Monitoring Executive, and you have passed the difficult training pro- gramme with flying colours. You have been selected from the Academy to be a Special Agent because of your unusual talents, having been born with Powers of the Mind: you can sense things that others can't and even influence their actions
through thought alone. These powers have been strengthened and focussed during your training and you have been issued with a Psionic Enhancer, a helmet which increases these mental powers. You have been taught to attack the minds of others with a blast of mental energy you call Thinkstrike. Your Power of Will allows you to control the minds of those weaker than you, and your Psychic Awareness allows you to sense things that others cannot, including the presence of another with such mental powers. This Psychic Awareness also lets you navigate your Time Machine through time and space. Few have such powers and even fewer are trusted with one of the small
number of Time Machines in existence.
You are expert in survival - including combat â armed and unarmed. History and detective powers of deduction have also been major subjects of study. You are now an Agent in the Time Police, whose job is to guard the Timelines of the past and to ensure that no-one tampers with past events in any way that would change things as they are now.
*
TIME, the Temporal Investigative and Monitoring Executive, was set up in Alpolis forty years ago shortly after Time Travel was discovered. The realisation that anyone with access to Time Travel could change the past so that the entire human race
 
might cease to exist was worrying, so Time Machines were built for the Time Police in their crystal domed TIME headquarters, in order to stop this. TIME is headed by five Lords, representing the most powerful groups in the Space Federation. Each of these has Powers of the Mind, and their own Time Machine.
The Executive is divided into four sections: Administrative, Research, Monitoring and the Special Agent Section (or SAS). The Monitoring Section, headed by Section Chief Jobanque, is responsible for noting any disturbances in the past, or Timelines, of the planets in the Federation. The Research Section, headed by Section Chief Skirrow is responsible for all equipment used by Special Agents and is also examining the possibilities of travel into the future, as yet impossible. Your own Special Agent Section is- headed by Section Chief Agidy Yelov, a Siriun humanoid from the Federation member planet, Sirius Secundus. Agidy Yelov and others have told you the importance of the First Law of TIME when on active service: 'A TIME Agent must, in all cases, act naturally according to the time in which he is currently operating, thus minimising any disruption of the Timelines his or her presence might be
causing'. As Yelov once said to you: There's no point in coming back to 3033 if you have left an atomic hand gun near Hitler's bunker, because this would change the present - in fact, you'd probably find you had never existed!' As with all Special Agents, your bloodline has been traced back, in your case to the French Revolution in 1789 AD. Should any one of your ancestors fail to produce the next in line it would be as if you had never existed.
Hints on Play
Your mission to find the Renegade Lord is a race against time, Falcon. You must catch up with the Lord before history can be changed or you will have failed, perhaps never have existed at all. You may find it useful to make a note of the places and times to which you travel so that you can form an idea of where to go next.
The rules are very simple - you could almost play this book without reading them at all. But reading the Personal Background and of course, the Mission Brief will help you to understand what is happening as you begin the adventure. If you come across something you don't understand, don't worry, check the Equipment List and this may give you a clue. If not,
carry on anyway, it will probably come clear later.
Good luck, and remember, the fate of the Space Federation rests in your hands.
Mission Brief
Touching the pad which changes the walls of your home to tranquil white you casually note how smart you look in your Dress Uniform in the mirror wall. It is less than an hour to your graduation ceremony, when you will stand before the Lords of TIME in the Hall of Honours and, taking these moments to relax, you remember the excitement of simulated ship-to-ship combat, the long hours of concentration as you worked on your Powers of the Mind, and the fascinating vid-lectures on history that were part of your course at the Academy. Though you excelled in all of these things, you are well aware that the job which you began officially today as a Special Agent of the Time Police will be the most challenging of any Federation citizen. The responsibility of guarding the past for all who live today weighs heavily but such sobering thoughts are interrupted by the quiet tone of your holophone.
You click your fingers and the remote accepts contact. Your section commander, Agidy Yelov, seems to appear in the room before you. The slitted pupils of his amber eyes narrow as they adapt to the white light. Tall, lean and cat-like, Yelov looks imposing in his steel grey uniform, his blue-black hair framing a face which betrays nothing. 'Falcon, I must see you before the ceremony. Come straight to my office.' He taps his desk, breaking the hob-link and vanishing before you can reply. Seconds later, you are on the moving pedway leading to his office in the Security Wing of TIME headquarters. As you leave the domed apartment, the blue sky is clear, and it is due to
remain so for a further 4.5 days.
The door to Yelov's office slides open at your touch - the building's Service Computer recognises your fingerprints. Agidy Yelov, standing before his Corn-console, beckons you in. 'Your pardon for this untimely intrusion, please be seated.' It is only as you step through the doorway that you notice Yelov is not alone. Jobanque, head of the Monitoring Section, is lying on a couch, a welcoming smile stretching his black features. You sit and the chair expands with a hiss to fit you snugly. Looking at

Yelov, you might think him nervous if you didn't believe him unable to feel anxiety. 'I have no time for the usual pleasantries.' His voice is hard. 'I know that this is your first mission, but Jobanque and I have picked you because you're the best person I've got. The fate of every being in the Federation and billions beyond will depend on you. We have lost an Agent. Q has been killed while on active service, investigating a disturbance of the Timeline of the planet Kelados. It seems he had found out who was responsible.'
Jobanque speaks next: 'His final transmission reported that he had identified the culprit as a Lord of TIME.' He pauses to watch your reaction to this incredible news. 'Unfortunately, Q died before he could tell us which one of the Lords is trying to change the past in order to gain power here and now, in 3033.'
Yelov continues brusquely: 'Of course, we can't arrest them all, they are our superiors and it is a difficult situation, particularly as far as the alien Lords of TIME are concerned. Because of this your mission has to be completely unofficial, but we must arrest or terminate the Renegade Lord as soon as we have proof and before anything disastrous occurs. When you have proof, do whatever you feel is necessary, Falcon. Is that understood?'
'Understood,' you reply.
Yelov continues: 'It will be a race against time; you may need to deal with an attempt to change the past within the next few hours.'
'Yes,' Jobanque breaks in, 'Q had already foiled one attempt in the Kelados Timeline, in 2710 AD. He was a fine agent. It is too late for you to do anything to save him, time passes in the Timeholes at the same rate as it passes in the present and if you travelled back to the same hole you would arrive after his death. I have identified an even earlier Timehole on Kelados, but Skirrow's men in the Tech Section say we can't send you back there and put you into cold sleep, to awaken at the time of Q's arrival, because of the rapid ageing effect of being away from your own time for extended periods.'
'Your machine is ready in the Eiger Vault,' Yelov goes on. 'We have no idea what the Renegade Lord's next move will be but all
the Lords will attend your graduation ceremony. All five of their Time Machines are logged in at the Vault, so none of them are meddlingwith the past as we speak. Go to your ceremony but remember, one of them is a traitor, a traitor to TIME and to the Space Federation. Good luck, Falcon. If you are not successful we may never meet again...'
Adyou turn to the door, Jobanque rises and says: 'Well be seeing you. Falcon.' You salute and leave, to begin your search for the Renegade Lord, wondering whether in fact you will ever see them or any of your friends again. The fate of worlds rests on your shoulders. Now turn over.

THE MISSION

[score a Q]
The door hums closed behind you as you step out of the high security wing which houses Section Chief Yelov's offices. Boarding the pedway you request the time. The Service Computer responds from a nearby speaker: 'It is three minutes, fifteen seconds to your appointment with the Lords of TIME at 10am, Falcon. If you would care to step into Lane 9, I can see that you arrive in time.' Realising that you have only a few moments to prepare, you transfer to Lane 9 and open a link to CAIN, punching in your Security Clearance Code on your Remote Access Terminal (RAT), a flexible keyboard and visual display incorporated into the left forearm of your uniform which you can use to communicate with CAIN via the building's Service Computer. The link opens. Do you:

Ask to see Special Agent Q's Termination Report?
Ask to see the last transmission which Special Agent Q submitted to Agidy Yelov?
Ask CAIN why Section Chief Yelov gave you so little warning about your mission prior to your ceremony?

Lord Speke's mind falls under your control. You hold him there as Alexander, exhausted, drops his sword again. Some of his men arrive in time to defend him. Within moments, the tide of battle is turned completely and the Macedonians, driven wild by the danger to their king, begin to massacre the townspeople. Alexander is borne away by several soldiers to be tended by the doctors in his tent. When the danger is past and the battle moved on, you take Lord Speke up to the hills. Looking into his mind you see that he has been breaking the First Law of TIME and living as an ancient Greek. He has always been careful not to upset the timelines seriously, but he knows he has been acting wrongly. His collection of ancient Greek weapons in his Time Machine is authentic and he has even buried ancient artifacts in places where he could 'discover' them as archaeological finds in the 31st century. Speke is not the Renegade Lord, and you release him from your control. Tears run down his face as he realises his hobby is over. 'At least', he says, 'I can say I saw the man whose people thought he was a god.' He asks you how you discovered him and you tell him about your mission. He is shocked by the news of a traitor Lord but offers a few words of advice: 'It is not likely to be either Pilota, or myself -we are both Earther stock and interference with Earth's past might mean that we had never existed.' You thank Speke but feel obliged to order him to return to 3033 AD and give himself up. Downcast, he agrees and returns to his Time Machine while you continue with your mission. Turn to 272.

5
He leaps at you as you grab for your blaster and trigger it just in time. A white bolt of superheated plasma eats into his chest. To your surprise, sparks fly and there is the unmistakable tang of vaporised metals. A nearby Plasma Sensor begins to flash and the siren of a Citpol jetcopter wails as the 'cydroid' buckles, short-circuiting in a sea of sparks, before falling inert. You have been fighting a machine. You examine it, but the damage is too severe for you to gain a clue as to its origins, before two Enforcers alight from their 'copter, pointing their stun-lances at you. 'Let's see your ID'. You produce your ID chip and hand it to the one who spoke, still covered by the other. He clips it into the Remote Access Terminal (RAT) on his arm and a look of disappointment crosses his features as he realises who you are. 'What's been going on here?' he says. You report exactly what happened and he returns your chip and turns to examine the cydroid. Turn to 137.

Knowing that Lynx is trained in the use of powers of the mind, you make a special effort to try to overcome her mental defences. Make a Thinkstrike Roll:
If you score 7-12, turn to 118
If you score 2-6, turn to 85

7
The ambulance trundles on towards Napoleon and you sense that the Renegade Lord is reaching out to control the Emperor's mind. You can no longer see Bloodhound and decide to attack when Napoleon begins to order the Imperial Guard to advance. As you do so, the Renegade Lord becomes aware of you and a wave of mental energy flows into you - your brain goes haywire. You seem to feel hot, cold, rain and fire all at once. It is as if you can see all colours at the same time and myriad voices speak every word in every language you have ever studied. Your brain overheats, literally burning itself out like a faulty electric motor. You are a zombie, incapable of thought, gurgling like a baby. You have failed.

8
Your mind is gripped like a vice and there is nothing you can do as your hand is forced inside your jacket. Sweating with effort, you try to stop yourself aiming your blaster at Bloodhound. Your arm quivers as you line him up in your sights. Bloodhound realises what is happening and reaches for his own blaster. He is too late. The lightning bolt of plasma hurls him into the wheel of the ambulance and his corpse slumps, a grotesque travesty of a human being. Your eyes are riveted on the muzzle of your death-dealing blaster as, inch by inch, you are forced to point it at yourself. Your hand is still shaking but your finger closes on the trigger and the left half of your face and head is wiped away. You have failed.

9
Your attack fails and is returned by a mental blast far more powerful than your own. You sink to the ground feeling as if your brain is boiling. Your brain is about to burn out like a faulty electric motor when the Renegade Lord's attention is shifted to Bloodhound who is making an attack of his own, saving your life as he does so. You fall unconscious and your powers of Think- strike will never again be what they were. Subtract one from your ThinkstrikeModifier. When you awake, Bloodhound is coming round, lying next to you. You shake your heads to clear the pain and look up to see that the Imperial Guard are marching to the attack. The Renegade Lord is changing history. You both begin to run up the hillside and the ambulance comes into view a hundred yards away from the Emperor. Turn to 344.

10
You step from the pedway at an interchange but dart into a | construction tunnel leading down to Old Geneva on the lower levels. As you emerge into the low-life area of the city the stench of sewers bathes you. The dark, squat buildings are made of old- fashioned concrete, a few even are of bricks, which you have only seen before in architectural museums. The Enforcers of Citpol seldom penetrate to these depths, preferring to leave the lowlifers to their own devices. There are no pedways or Plasma Sensors down here, just graffiti and cracked tarmac. You plunge into a blank-eyed crowd of leisure zombies, milling around the sim-combat booths, unnoticed, and unfollowed. You search for a different way back to the upper levels. Turn to 146.

11
You splash your way into the pond and grab for the rope ladder which is hanging from your flyer. Shouts ring out behind you and an arrow hits you in the bottom as you climb. You pull it out but are losing blood. Lose 4 Endurance points. Panting, you kneel in the cockpit and fire up the flyer's Drive and the ladder slowly retracts. The flyer rocks unsteadily as if the stabilisers were malfunctioning. Looking down, you see the dark eyes, wide with fright, of a mongol guard swinging from the ladder, a torch burning in his hand. You dip the flyer down across the pool, plunging him into the water and the flyer bucks skyward as he falls from the ladder. Realising that all of the guards on the ground are now alerted you decide to risk hovering above the palace roof, hoping to find the balcony on which Ogedai appeared earlier. Turn to 28.

The Creche are weakened - there are only five of them left alive, and you are combining your powers. Make a Thinkstrike Roll.
If you score 7-12, turn to 83
If you score 2-6, turn to 204

13
You cannot control Speke, his mind is too strong, but he has realised you are here. Alexander, exhausted, drops his sword and Speke, picking it up, defends him from attack. Within moments, the tide of battle is turned completely and the Macedonians, driven wild by the danger to their king, begin to massacre the townspeople. Alexander is borne away by several soldiers to be tended by the doctors in his tent. When the danger is past and the battle moved on, Lord Speke approaches carrying Alexander's sword and gives himself up. You walk up into the hills, and he explains that for some time he has been breaking the First Law of TIME and living as an ancient Greek. He has always been careful not to upset the timelines seriously but he knows he has been acting wrongly. His collection of ancient Greek weapons in his Time Machine is authentic and he has even buried ancient artifacts in places where he could 'discover' them as archaeological finds in the 31st century. You look into his mind, with his consent, and see that it is all true - Speke is not the Renegade Lord. Tears run down his face as he realises his hobby is over. 'At least,' he says, 'I can say I saw the man whose people thought he was a god.' He asks you how you discovered him and you tell him about your mission. He is shocked by the news of a traitor Lord but offers a few words of advice. 'It is not likely to be either Pilota, or myself - we are both Earther stock and interference with Earth's past might mean that we had never existed.' You thank Speke but feel obliged to order him to return to 3033 AD and give himself up. Downcast, he agrees and returns to his Time Machine while you continue with your mission. Turn to 272.

You give your Epsilon Security Code and the micro-display on your wrist lights up. The report on Q's death seems surprisingly brief:

The flyer hovers above the darkest part of the palace gardens and you release the rope ladder from its edge. You climb down cautiously, unable to see the ground; it is black as pitch. You step down off the ladder and catch your breath as you find yourself waist deep in freezing water. You have climbed down into the ornamental pond. You stand still, waiting to see if you've been heard, then wade out trying not to splash and walk stealthily between cherry trees towards the torch-lights of the palace. Pausing to take stock of your surroundings you notice two guards at the rear of the palace, guarding a small wooden door. Nearby is a low wooden building with several horses tethered to posts outside it. Do you:

Thinkstrike the two guards?
Try to control them both, using your Power of Will?
Pull out your blaster and fry them?

You instruct CAIN to examine the Eiger Service Computer and type your Epsilon Security Clearance Code at the terminal, before asking for information relating to a cydroid, serial number SAT17YV. Moments later, CAIN responds. 'SAT Section Security Cydroid 17YV, built 3027, assigned to Section Chief Agidy Yelov. Reported missing 3031, prior to discontinuation of this model due to faults in Central Processing unit. Armed: Particle Disrupter, Sensors: Infra-red, ultra-violet and radar. Appearance: man-like.Intelligenceunit: Fordec 5000. Power Plant -'
'Reported missing' You interrupt the list of specifications.
'Yes, Falcon. SAT Section Chief Agidy Yelov reported that it tried to kill him before escaping into Old Geneva. No witnesses. Some damage to Yelov's office, certainly caused by a Particle Disrupter. No further information.'
If you wish to call up Yelov's file, note the number 15 on your Agent Profile.

Your opponent's reactions are even faster than yours. He catches your leg in his hand and then, with amazing strength, begins to crush it slowly. Pain overcomes you and you pass out, never to come round. You have failed, Falcon.

19
You bank and dive as twin laser pulses from the Phocian flash past your ship into the blackness of space. Then the Phocian increases speed. A third, larger ship appears on the Scanner, beyond an Asteroid Belt, and the Corsair changes course to intercept. You match course and increase speed as a second message reaches you, this time from the larger ship. 'This is the Clanship Keladan HI; we are on a priority diplomatic mission. Do not attack, repeat, do not attack. Change course. We are Keladi; do not attack.' You realise that this is the convoy ship carrying Korakiik, and that they will soon be within the attack range of the Phocian Corsair. Do you:

As you wait for the green, a security guard approaches, wearing a full-face helmet and power-armour, which is not standard issue. He carries a laser-rifle.

Bloodhound shouts: 'No, Falcon, Thinkstrike!' Too late, you realise you have made a mistake, for the Creche, although reduced in number to five, are masters of mind control. They take you over, and you draw your blaster and kill Bloodhound before he realises what is happening. Staring in horror at what you have done, you feel your hand turning the blaster towards your own head. The last thing you see before you kill yourself is Agidy Yelov stepping from behind the Time Machine of the Creche. Only Lynx is left to defeat him and the Renegade Lord. You have failed.

22
You leave the Hall of Honours en route for the Eiger Vault and your Time Machine, and approach the hovrail, calling a car to the nearest embarkation point using CAIN and the Service Computer.
Stepping from the TIME building pedway you emerge into the cityscape, to be dwarfed by the tiered office blocks surrounded by housing for the workers and the Prodmarkets which supply them. Jetcopters hum overhead like streams of flies, each one, darting or circling, its pilot intent on reaching particular destin- ations. The lower level streets and pedways are thick with people; those streets which curve up to the higher levels and along the buttresses of the larger buildings bear a steady flow of skimmers, runners sparking as they contact the electrified streetmetal. Some way from the embarkation point you realise that you are being followed. You step from the pedway onto the deserted bay of the Intelfax building. The anonymous figure of an office worker in a one-piece suit steps off the pedway behind you. Do you:

You lose confidence in your Thinkstrike ability, subtract one from your Thinkstrike Modifier. Do you:

Clone's mind is a maze of violent and selfish impulses, easily controlled. You make him call off his gang and in amazement they goggle as you force Clone to let you climb up behind him. 'But Machine is dead,' cries one of the women.
Before they can protest further Clone whisks you away to the edge of Old Geneva and you relinquish control of his mind as you step onto the pedway once more.'I'llget you for this, mutie mind-scrambler, they'll never follow me now, I'll remember you...'

A lancing white bolt of superheated plasma misses your target and smashes a hole in the end wall of the corridor. One of the guards fires his laser rifle as the other runs towards you. He wings you in the side - lose 4 Endurance points. Then, two security droids arrive and your assailants run back down the corridor, darting out of sight. You give your Security Clearance Code and identify yourself. Satisfied, the security droids chase the two would-be assassins and you return to the safety of Falcon's Wing. Turn to 336.

The flyer hovers above the palace roof and you jump down from it onto the wood slats, then swing over the edge of the roof and drop to the torch-lit balcony below. As you do so you are noticed by some people in the palace courtyard. There is an uproar. You see that silk curtains are spread across the entrance to the room. Parting them you enter a bedchamber. Inside, sitting on a large litter, swaddled in silks and furs, is Ogedai Khan, still weak from his illness. He looks up, his narrow eyes questioning your purpose. Golden statues, treasure chests and tapestries line the walls. The door opens and two men burst in, brandishing swords, alerted by the noise of the crowd. One is a member of the Khan's Imperial Guard, dressed immaculately in black and gold lacquered armour, the other an older man, a general or 'Noyan', wearing a simple wrap-around leather cloak lined with fur. You have no time to draw your blaster as they close to attack. Do you:

You dismount and walk towards the new mental presence, looking carefully about you. Suddenly a drummer boy who had been wandering forlornly up the hillside turns to you and speaks. To your surprise it is a woman's voice - that of Lynx, a Special Agent of TIME, like Bloodhound and yourself. The disguise is perfect - her boyish features are smeared with mud from the battlefield. 'Falcon, Bloodhound, I have a Termination Order for you both from our leader, Agidy Yelov.' With that, she unleashes a Hornet, a miniature guided missile, like an arrow with wings, which jets towards you. Do you:

35
You bring the soldier under your control and force him to discharge his musket through a crack in the ambulance's side pplanking. Bloodhound suddenly tenses and, drawing his blaster, takes aim at you. You are about to dive onto the ground when the musket goes off and Bloodhound regains control of himself. You run up to the ambulance, but before you arrive the hunt explodes and a flyer accelerates out of it. Six giant ants, their red eyes glaring at you balefully, are clinging onto the honeycomb-like seats. One of them appears to have been killed bya musket ball. You realise it is the Hivers, Creche 82282. The Creche skim low through the smoke of the battlefield, almost faster than the eye can see, making a sonic boom like the explosion of a powder magazine, the ammunition stores for the cannon. As they go you catch the thought that they are heading for the planet Hel. You have succeeded in preserving the past and decide to follow the Creche to Hel. Turn to 161.

36
You give your Epsilon Security Code and the micro-display on your wrist lights up,

Knowing that your Epsilon Security Code should be high enough to gain access, you request the level of Security Code necessary. CAIN responds with the information that this report has been reclassified: Access Code Theta.

Rippingthe ambulance doors open reveals a bizarre sight, six creatures like giant ants, mandibles clicking in agitation are backinginto a honeycomb structure, their dull, red, compound eyes menacing. One shrivels as the white-hot plasma from your blaster hits home; they were concentrating on controlling Napoleon once more. The honeycomb is on top of a flyer, similar In design to your own and you both throw yourselves back to the ground outside to avoid the Ion Drive exhaust as the flyer explodes from the front of the ambulance. You sense that the six Hiver beings who together are Lord Creche, the Renegade Lord, are flying back to their Time Machine, with one exception. The victim of your Thinkstrike had not reached his seat in the honeycomb. Toppling backwards as the flyer took off, it was vapourised by the Ion Drive. Quickly you search the ambulance and find a small capsule. It is an Interstellar Code, a message from Agidy Yelov to the Creche suggesting that if the mission is aborted, they should effect a rendezvous on planet Hel. As quickly as you can, after checking that the Emperor's Imperial Guard are not advancing, you decide to follow the Creche. Turn to 161.

The French have begun to launch an attack on the great earthen ramparts which the Russians are defending, and along the left- hand end of the Russian line. Great columns of blue-coated soldiers toil uphill towards their green-jacketed enemies. The guns roar and belch smoke and the crackle of musket fire begins. Bothsides have magnificently dressed cavalry. Some of these, called Cuirassiers, after the metal breastplate they wear, are big men mounted on what are almost cart-horses. Your own horses, bays, are much nimbler and more fleet of foot, and resemble those nearest to you, a battalion of Polish lancers under Prince Poniatowski's command. Their lance pennants, blue and white, flutter in the wind.

You call up the Free Fall Recreation Centre at Spiro's Ringworld, a massive wheel-like world-in-miniature, orbiting earth. Their holo-coordinator seems to appear in your Time Machine. She is a striking girl, her skin tinted blue with orange flashes. She puts you through to Lord Pilota's personal assistant. He is a bony, hollow-cheeked man, showing signs of the Medawar Syn- drome, the onset of rapid ageing. You identify yourself and ask for Her Lordship and the hologram winks out momentarily. When the holo-picture of the assistant reappears, he says: 'Lord Pilota is temporarily indisposed. Under no circumstances may she be contacted at the moment. If you would care to visit Spiro's Ringworld, however, she will be pleased to grant you immediate audience, as she believes she has some information which may interest you, as an Agent of the TIME Police.'
With that, he breaks contact and the blue-skinned coordinator Informs you that the line has been closed to all callers and asks: 'What is that weird spaceship you're in?' CAIN informs you that in lieu of requisitioning a shuttle from the Eiger Base you could dock at Spiro's Ringworld in eighteen minutes.

Your aim was true. A lancing white bolt of superheated plasma erupts against one of the guards. He is blown back against the end wall of the corridor and then slumps to the floor. The second guard runs off as two security droids arrive. You walk up to the fallen man after giving your Security Code to the hovering droids as they aim their stun-lasers at you. You identify yourself. Satisfied, they begin to hunt the second assassin. Your fallen assailant is dying, there is nothing you can do. You ask who sent him, and lean close to hear him gasp: 'Time Lord ...', but the rest is lost in a spasm of coughing as he dies. You head back to the safety of Falcon's Wing. Turn to 336.

You wake up dazed, in a detention cubicle at TIME head quarters. Your arms and legs are secured through holes in couch upon which you are lying and you no longer have you helmet.

She is still dressed in her drummer's uniform but her hair falls freely about her shoulders now that she has taken her shako-helmet off. She looks pleased with herself. Behind her, Yelov, amber eyes glinting, also looks satisfied. Suddenly all goes blank. Your last sight is of Yelov beginning to laugh as both you and Agent Lynx wink out. He has tricked her. It is as if you both had never existed. You have failed.

You try to control his mind but he throws himself at you and you tumble down the hillside, locked together. Bloodhound tries to strangle and kick you. You are bruised and exhausted, by the time you break the Renegade Lord's control of his will. Lose 3 Endurancepoints. Bloodhound stops fighting and you both look up to see that the Imperial Guard are marching to the attack. The Renegade Lord is changing history. You begin to run up the hillside and the ambulance comes into view a hundred yards away from the Emperor. Turn to 344.

Bloodhound is sprawled in his Autodoc, ready for you. As you aim your blaster, lit in the glow of the Access Disc, so the superheated plasma from his weapon catches you. in the belly, turning your guts to steam. Death is instantaneous. You have failed.

You strap yourself into the crash couch, which at a command from CAIN, moves backwards and swivels upwards into your flyer and the flyer's cockpit canopy clicks into place. The Launch Doors at the top of Falcon's Wing slide apart and the flyer is catapulted into the outside air. Turn to 400.

Napoleon's will is too strong for you and you realise you cannot control him. In your efforts, you have failed to notice Bloodhound beside you, controlled by the Renegade Lord, tense up and draw his blaster. As you turn towards him he pulls the trigger and you are vapourised. You have failed and the Space Federation will never be.

80
You drop into the long grass beside the ambulance and the Hornet drops down towards you, shattering as it hits the side of the ambulance, which you placed between it and yourself. Unfortunately, it does not explode and damage the ambulance, perhaps because its microcomputer registers the fact that it has not found its target. Bloodhound moves in to attack Lynx hand- to-hand, as she closes in on you and at the same moment you sense that the Renegade Lord is reaching out to control the Emperor's mind, realising that using your mental powers will give your position away, will you:

For three hours you circle the hill near Shevardino on which Napoleon's Command Post is set up, but there is no sign of the Renegade Lord. At one time, Napoleon is forced to receive the attentions of an Army surgeon and you overhear a rumour that he may have had a minor stroke. He recovers, however, and you continue your vigil. Bloodhound looks at you and motions you to concentrate - soon you can feel a presence approaching, a very strong mental presence. Your heads turn as one towards a strange contraption coming nearer Napoleon and his escort. Two horses, one behind the other, are harnessed to a wooden, covered wagon with two small holes high up on either side for windows and doors which open at the back. A medical orderly is riding the first of the horses. It is one of the first ambulances ever made of the pattern designed by Baron Larrey, a French Army Surgeon, in 1805. The strength of the mental presence within the ambulance leads you to believe that the Renegade Lord must be inside, and you prepare to attack together. Turn to 53.

The Creche tumble, stunned, onto the tree carpet and you move forward to make sure of your victory. Suddenly, Agidy Yelov, wearing a Psionic Damper Circlet on his head, that gives protection from mental attacks, appears from behind the Creche's Time Machine and a bolt of white lightning leaps from his blaster, burning the Hivers to a crisp. You hesitate in surprise as he turns to you, his blaster pointing at the ground. 'Well done Falcon, Bloodhound. Of course you know that I had set up a trap for the Renegade Lord, but I really must congratulate you for a truly outstanding performance against the Creche.' Bloodhound looks at you to see what you will do. Will you:

Blast Yelov?

For ten minutes you race through the confusion of the battlefield towards your Time Machines as the Imperial Guard approach the Russians. It is too late to call off the attack now. MarshalNey has flung his men at the Russians, confident of success now that he has reinforcements. Unfortunately, your ancestor, the young hussar, is killed leading the charge and all goes black.

Pilota responds, her voice high-pitched in the thin air, 'I noticed yesterday that someone has spent much time researching the history of Earth around the Timehole of 1241 AD. A very great deal of time, according to the Central Library Log. I suggest you make it your first mission to investigate that Timehole, just in case someone is doing something they shouldn't be. I know that there isn't much to go on here; call it a hunch if you like, but I would appreciate it if you would move quickly and check that all is well.'
You decide to keep your real mission secret and return to Earth for further information. Saluting Pilota and taking your leave, you are back at the console of your Time Machine within thirty minutes. CAIN confirms that what Pilota says about the library is true and that Pilota herself is not the one who has researched this part of Earth history.

You miss the Hornet and it finds its target. To your surprise it is not filled with explosive but with a drug which sends you quickly to sleep. You wake again some minutes later to find Lynx and Bloodhound struggling on the ground, locked in combat.BloodhoundisbleedingbadlyandLynxismanoeuvring so that she can finish him off with the knife she is wielding. You move quietly over and chop her in the back of the neck, knocking her out cold. Bloodhound sighs with relief and thanks you. Looking around, you take stock of the situation. Everybody has moved off down the hill towards the line of battle. The Imperial Guard are marching to the attack and the ambulance, too, is trundling away down the hill. Napoleon has ordered the attack and the Renegade Lord has changed the past. Turn to 344.

89
You were not fast enough. Two blasts of plasma at short range vapourise most of your body. You have confronted the Renegade Lord but failed at the last moment.

90
They hold their heads in pain, but the Imperial guard recovers and attacks you ferociously. You manage to keep out of his way for a time, dodging and weaving, but cannot find a way past the swirling of his sword and soon others pour into the room from the banqueting hall below and you are taken. The fate of the Khan's assassin is not a pleasant one. They discuss your punishment which will be to have molten silver poured into your eyes and ears, before you are boiled alive, a death reserved for their respected enemies. You have failed and the Space Federation will never be.

91
Despite the fall of Clone, they come on, howling for revenge and you are faced with a solid wall of spiked steel. You are dashed backwards into Machine's bike and before you can pull yourself up, one of them turns off his hover rotor, allowing his bike to settle heavily on your legs. Several others dismount, laughing cruelly. You stare at the spiked metal-capped boots which soon start to kick you senseless. Grabbing your helmet, they leave you for dead. Lose 16 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you cannotuse your mental powers until you have taken a new helmet from the equipment locker of your Time Machine.
You wake up in the Health Executive Hospital, a medtech orderlybending over you, saying, 'We've put you back together again - Rapid Tissue Regeneration. I'm afraid you may find a slight weakness in the right knee. Subtract one from your Evasion Modifier but restore your Endurance to 18. Declining further sedation you discharge yourself from the hospital and board a hovrail car in the Vault. Leaving the car at the Eiger Vault you walk to the Checkpoint outside the enormous plasteel doors where your ID chip is checked and the Mind Scanner is used to double check that you are Falcon. You step through a small personnel door, past two security droids and into the cavern which houses the TimeMachines and the Research Section of TIME. The area in which the machines are kept is partitioned at intervals and you head straight for your own bay. In the centre of the bay which is lined on three sides with racks carrying maintenance equip- ment, spare parts, the Variac Drive Recharger and sundry other useful items, lies Falcon's Wing. You approach the Access Hatch and the Mind Scanner lights up red and then green and you are drawn up into the machine by invisible Tractor Beams, activated by CAIN. Soon you are standing on the glowing Access Disc and CAIN chimes, 'Welcome, Falcon.' Turn to 210.

You soon detect a hologram of trees at the forest's edge, further from the village. You approach it warily but are jarred backwards by an invisible force-field that glows orange as you touch it. Lose 2 Endurance points.
You are amazed that such a field can be generated from so small an area as the inside of a Time Machine. This is beyond the technology of Earth. You cannot even approach closely enough to see through the hologram and confirm whose the Time Machine is. You have no choice but to follow the flyer to Karakorum. Turn to 76.

93
You wend your way through the fog of battle but your horse catches its foot in a burrow and goes lame. You abandon it and continue on foot, but in the cannon smoke you lose your way. The sound of firing is all around you and you mistake some Russians for Frenchmen who are withdrawing for a new attack When the srnoke clears you realise you have wandered close to the Russians. Bugles sound behind you and a charge of French infantry is launched with Marshal Ney at their head. The Frenchmen, singing the Marseillaise, come on shoulder-to- shoulder, magnificent in their blue and white uniforms. You are swept up in the charge and carried forward, unable to do anything against the hundreds of men, exhilarated in the heat of battle. On the redoubt ahead of you, the Russian commander, Prince Bagration, rides out in front of his line of green jacketed men and salutes the French columns, crying in French, 'Bravo, messieurs, c'est superbe!' As you approach Bagration's men they unleash a hail of musket fire and you take this opportunity to throw yourself to the ground as if dead, and let the charge pass over you.
Afterwards, battered and muddied, you pick yourself up. You have found no trace of the Renegade Lord and you decide to return to Napoleon's Command Post at Shevardino in case Bloodhound needs help. You are approaching the Command Post when Bloodhound rides to greet you. You tell him of your experiences and decide to look for Murat, the King of Naples, when you both feel a presence approaching, a very strong mental presence. Your heads turn as one towards a strange contraption coming nearer Napoleon and his escort. Two horses, one behind the other, are harnessed to a wooden, covered wagon with two small holes high up on either side for windows and doors which open at the back. A medical orderly is riding the first of the horses. It is one of the first ambulances ever made of the pattern designed by Baron Larrey, a French Army Surgeon, in 1805.

With a great effort you manage to dominate their wills, holding them under control. You walk up to them and order them to take you to Ogedai Khan and to pretend you are a messenger. They walk through the door with a rolling, bandy-legged gait and you follow entering a store room lined with barrels of Koumiss, fermented mare's milk. A row of carcasses hangs on hooks above a smoking fire. In the corner lies the huddled form of an unconscious mongol, obviously drunk. The two guards lead you out of a door opposite into a banqueting hall whose walls are lined with gold, the plunder of half the world. It is full of mongols, eating and drinking. To your surprise there are no tables, but a great fire has been lit in the centre of the hall. Musicians are playing fast rhythmic music and some of the mongols strut around the fire, showing off the splendour of their leather coats, decorated and lined with fur. Others are still gorging themselves, tearing chunks of meat from whole carcasses with their hunting knives. As the music quickens, some begin to whirl and leap around the fire, dancing wildly. Your guards lead you up a wooden stairway just to the left of the storeroom door. Turn to 278.

The battle is fierce but soon Bloodhound is attacking your mind and before you can recover he has blasted you again. You double up as the plasma bolt hits your side - lose 13 Endurancepoints. If you are still alive, you find yourself too stunned to do anything. Bloodhound walks over to your stricken body and levels his weapon for the final blast. 'Wait, Bloodhound! Kill me and the population of all Earth and the colonies may perish. I am helpless, but look at CAIN's memory banks before you void me.' He hesitates, then drags you into Falcon's Wing and ties you up. Examining CAIN's records, it soon becomes obvious to him that you are on a vitally important mission and that his mission to kill you must be abandoned. He unties you, but your wounds are so bad you must subtract one from your Evasion Modifier.
Bloodhound says, 'I'm sorry, Falcon, someone has used me, someone who wants the timelines to be changed.'
'Who gave the order to kill me?' you ask.
'Our Section Chief, Agidy Yelov,' he replies. 'He told me you had killed Lord Kirik.'
'But Kirik has only been dead a matter of minutes,' you tell him.
Bloodhound pauses, then says, 'Yes, of course, Falcon, how can he know of Kirik's death so soon? Either he was responsible or he is in league with the traitor that did it.' Your Section Chief is working with the Renegade Lord. Turn to 255.

AH you approach the carriage the mind inside senses you and you are locked in a battle of wills. It is a battle which you are hound to lose as the Renegade Lord's mind is stronger than yours. All of your being is taken up with the struggle when, abruptly,the attack ceases. You shake your head dizzily, but it is only the lull before the storm. A wave of mental energy flows intoyou and your brain goes haywire. You seem to feel hot, cold,rain and fire all at once. It is as if you can see all colours at once and myriad voices speak in every language you have ever studied. Your brain overheats, literally burning itself out like a faulty electric motor.

Suddenly the screen flares as the Phocian Corsair opens fire on the Keladi ship, its lasers piercing the hull of the larger ship which lurches sickeningly. You decide to open fire in order to prevent the death of the envoy, Korakiik, realising that whoever is controlling the Phocian desires war between the Keladi and Earth. You are too late. As your finger moves to the fire button the Corsair rakes the envoy's ship again with its Pulse Lasers. There is a brilliant explosion which fills the scanner screen with light and then you are suddenly engulfed in blackness. You find yourself in a smoke-filled shelter, a fugitive from an alien race on your own world. The past has been changed and your memories with it. You leap out of the shelter to hurl a grenade at a strange alien aircraft on the street above you... As Falcon, Agent of TIME, you have failed.

105
A brilliant white bolt of burning plasma takes your would-be assassin in the chest, knocking him backwards and taking his life as it melts through his armour. You kneel by him as a security droid arrives. Seeing signs of life in his eyes, though he is beyond help, you ask who sent him to kill you. 'One of the Lords...' His words are choked off by a rattling cough as the blood from his lungs begins to spill from his mouth and death takes him.
The security droid hovers towards you, its stun-lance aimed. You hand over your identification and report what happened. A message appears in red on the screen set in the droid's chest. 'ID - Passed. Your story coincides with videographic evidence. A report will be filed. Please continue your business.'And it begins to drag the body of your assailant out of the bay. Turn to 336.

I ho outside camera begins to swivel, showing you the land all around. Behind you is a forest, shrouded in snow, and the Hologram Generator disguises Falcon's Wing as part of this forest. You are on high ground and to the right you can see a village with a pall of smoke rising above it. Outside the village is a mound of bodies, each missing both ears. The mongols have been busy. Ahead, the frosted ground falls away into a wide river valley. The river is frozen over but you can plainly see its gracefulcurves stretching to a walled city a few miles away. Here and there on the plain you can see parties of horsemen riding swiftly. You ask CAIN for some historical information. CAIN responds. 'It is winter, 1241 AD. The city you see is Vienna and the river, the Danube. The mongol horde led by the general, Subatai, has conquered Russia and Poland, and defeated a western army at Liegnitz, before overrunning Hungary.They are a few miles from Vienna, poised to ravage the rest of Europe. Their ruler is Ogedai, son of Ghenghis Khan. He will die within the next few days and when the news reaches the Golden Horde, they must, under Ghengis Khan's code of law, the Yasa, return to the mongol capital, Karakorum, to decide who will succeed him. Vienna will not fall and Europe will be saved.'
You break in, 'And if Ogedai should live?'
CAIN continues, The likelihood is that Europe would be overrun and the timelines changed beyond recognition. Civilisation would be set back a thousand years.'
As you reach for your holo-detector, a black disc-like shape crosses your path of vision, streaking skyward with a sound like a thunderclap. CAIN chimes, 'A small Ion Drive craft, probably a flyer, has taken off nearby.' You ask for an estimate of its destination and CAIN responds, 'I estimate China. The mongol capital, Karakorum, is in China, Falcon.' Do you:

Bloodhound passes out, slumping to the floor of the refuelling bay. You drag him to Falcon's Wing and tie him up in front of CAIN, removing his Psionic Enhancer helmet as you do so. When he comes round you show him CAIN's records. It soon becomes obvious to him that you are on a vitally important mission and that his mission to kill you must be abandoned. You untie him and return his helmet. Bloodhound says, I'm sorry, Falcon, someone has used me, someone who wants the timelines to be changed.'
'Who gave the order to kill me?' you ask.

A lancing white bolt of superheated plasma strikes the cydroid which short-circuits in a flood of sparks and pitches forward, inert. A nearby Plasma Sensor begins to flash, signalling Citpol Enforcers, the civil police. A blue and gold Citpol jetcopter lands nearby as you examine the charred remains of the cydroid, but the damage is too severe for you to gain a clue as to its origins. Two Enforcers alight from their 'copter, pointing their stun- lances at you. 'Let's see your ID.' You produce your ID chip and hand it to the one who spoke, still covered by the other. He clips it into his Remote Access Terminal (RAT) on his arm and a look of disappointment crosses his features, as he realises who you are. 'What's been going on here?' he says. You report exactly what happened and he returns your chip and turns to examine the cydroid. Turn to 137.

The silver doors hiss apart, affording you your first view of the Hall of Honours, which boasts a marble floor and colonnades. In the centre is a large oaken table, in the shape of a horseshoe, the only wood in the TIME building, around which sit the five Lords of TIME. Your Universal Translator synthesises an unusual waterygurgling into words of welcome that sound in your ear:
Welcome, Agent Falcon, never has a candidate graduated from the Academy with so high a score.' Your self-control allows you to smother any outward betrayal of surprise at the sight of the being which greets you. Submerged in a huge tank, along with some small aquatic mammals, is what looks like a giant lobster with bloated bluish brain-sacs floating under its spiked carapace. It waves a fearsome purplish pincer and clicks and gurgles: 'I am Time Lord Kirik of the Keladi.'
You bow respectfully and turn to look at the other Lords. You recognise Lord Speke, a dapper little Earther in a Navy 'dress uniform'. On his left sits a squat, humanoid figure, with blue â¢kin and a mane of bristling white hairs - Lord Silvermane of Rigel Prime. On the other side of the table sits Lord Pilota, a seven-foot tall Lastlander woman with the fragile build and sharp-boned features of all those who live on that low gravity world. She is supported in her chair by a hydraulic exoskeleton which gives her the appearance of a robot, but it is the fifth Lord of TIME sitting on her right who looks the strangest of them all. A network of silica, like an oversized honeycomb, rests on the floor. Inside each of the six cells of the honeycomb is what looks like a giant ant, swathed in silk, like a cocoon. Their front parts protrude from the silk, plainly showing dull-red, compound eyes and wicked looking mandibles which are in constant motion. Collectively, they are called The Creche 82282 and they are six parts of a communal mind, in constant mind-link with each other. They are Hivers, a separate part of the Hive.
The ceremony is brief; you swear an oath of allegiance to TIME and are duly commissioned as a Special Agent. Pilota rises and steps forward, uncomfortable in the relatively high gravity of earth, and pins your wings to your chest. Your Universal Translator renders a mixed babel of applause. The ceremony is drawing to a close and you still have little information on the Lords of TIME. You know that this will be your last chance to meet them together in the same room for some time, perhaps for ever. If you know why Section Chief Yelov did not contact you until the last minute about your mission, turn to 153. If you do not, will you:

Instead of asking you to help with the bodies of the Hivers, Yelov swings up his blaster and fires. He is very quick and his aim is true. You are hurled backwards and find yourself, badly wounded, falling through a gap in the foliage to the leaf mould which covers the ground below. Seconds later, Bloodhound falls a few yards away from you. He is unconscious. One of the trees seems to bend slightly above him. Suckers which sprout from its trunk begin to converge on him slowly. They wrap around him and he begins to dissolve. You too are caught by tentacles and you hear Yelov's laughter deadened by the foliage as you succumb to the man- eating tree. You have failed.

Once again you are at the forest's edge, overlooking the Danube and Vienna.The nearby village of Ramallolies under a pall of smoke. The mongols have finished their grisly work and a pile of corpses which lack ears lies near the edge of the village. You can see your own footsteps, muddled with hoofprints on the ground outside.
As you reach for your Holo-detector, a black disc-like shape crosses your path of vision, streaking skyward with a sound like athunderclap.CAINchimes,'AsmallIonDrivecraft,probablya flyer, has taken off nearby.' You ask for an estimate of its destination and CAIN responds, 'I estimate China. The mongol capital,Karakorum,isinChina,Falcon.Letmeremindyouthat Ogedai Khan should be dying there even now.

You spur your horse forward towards Murat and his staff when the source of the mental power comes into view. Two horses, one behind the other, are harnessed to a wooden, covered wagon with two small holes high up on either side for windows and doors which open at the back. A medical orderly is riding the first of the horses. It is one of the first ambulances ever made of the pattern designed by Baron Larrey, a French Army Surgeon, in 1805. You sense the strength of the mind within the strange carriage and its power seems awesome to you. As you watch, you can feel the mind reaching out to control Murat, King of Naples, Do you:

It soon becomes obvious to him that you are on a vitally important mission and that his mission to kill you must be abandoned. You release him from your control and Bloodhound says, 'I'm sorry, Falcon, someone has used me, someone who wants the timelines to be changed.'
'Who gave you the order to kill me?' you ask.
'Our Section Chief, Agidy Yelov,' he replies. 'He told me you had killed Lord Kirik.'
'But Kirik has only been dead a matter of minutes,' you tell him.

The drunken revelry continues and you manage to cross the banqueting hall and leave through the store room without trouble.

You wade silently into the ornamental pond and, using the rope ladder, climb back into your flyer. Turn to 254.

You roll aside and come up ready to fire your blaster into the ambulance. The Hivers are scurrying backwards out of sight, but you send a bolt of plasma after them. One of them is too slow and it is torched to a frazzle by the white-hot beam. You are getting ready to leap into the ambulance when its front explodes and a flyer accelerates out of it, the Hivers clinging on inside the honeycomb-like seats.

Your shock wave of thought topples one of the lancers from the saddle and Bloodhound and Lynx have been similarly successful with two of the other lancers. The remaining one catchesLynx in the shoulder before she can topple him with the power of her thought, but she grabs the lance and swings herself up on it, kicking the lancer in the face. He tumbles, unconscious, from the saddle but Lynx falls beside him. She is badly wounded and has to return to her Autodoc. She urges you to go on, saying: 'I'll see you at the Eiger Vault Rec Centre,'and wishes you luck before limping away. You run to catch up with the ambulance. Turn to 251.

You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole in the time of Alexander the Great. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everythingaround you seems grey and insubstantial. You knowthat should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank - not even blackness exists in Null-space. You cast your thought into the void and using your Psychic Awareness locate the Timehole of Alexander the Great. When you have translated this location into co-ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take around an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points.
You rematerialise and the Holo-projector makes Falcon's Wing look like a bleak hillock. Your exterior camera shows a small range of desolate hills giving way to a dry plain crossed by a small river. You press 'hold' and the camera stops swivelling as a small city of mud-baked houses surrounded by tall, white stone walls and towers appears on the screen. It is what lies before the city which catches your eye. An e n t i r e army, perhaps forty thousand strong, is encamped before the city walls. The tattered tents are braced against the breeze and hundreds of wagons stand in a second camp further from the city, where gaggles of wagoners, camp followers and walking wounded seem to mock the orderly precision of the ranks of men, resplendent in their armour, the sun glinting from the tips of their sixteen-foot-long spears. They stand as if on parade. You ask CAIN what happened here, historically, He chimes. This city is the local capital. The people marches out to give battle to Alexander the Great and his army of Macedonians and troops from other conquered lands, two days ago, but fled when they saw Alexander and his men Alexander is returning from India to Babylon, the capital of his new empire and has decided to take this city. His men do not want to risk their lives again and he will soon head the assault in an attempt to inspire them. Realising that he is going to risk his life, his men will throw themselves onto the siege ladders, but these will be broken in their eagerness. Two men only will be with Alexander when he jumps down into the city and he will be severely wounded before the Macedonians break down the gates and rescue him ...'
'Thank you CAIN,' you interrupt. 'What action would change the Timeline here?'
CAIN says, The assassination of Alexander would seem the most likely option, but I cannot compute the effect this would have on the past. Alexander will die in only a few years from now at the age of-thirty-three and his empire will be divided up and fought over by his successors.' CAIN programmes the Molecular Converter to create the dress of a phalangite, a Macedonian warrior, and you step from Falcon's Wing wearing sandals, bronze greaves, a long heavy skirt of boiled leather strips, a breastplate, and a small round shield strapped to your left forearm. Your Psionic Enhancer becomes a crested helmet covering your face, with a Y-shaped slit for you to see through. Unable to wield a sixteen-foot-long 'sarissa' you make do with a short sword.

You concentrate your mind on whoever is inside the ambulance, knowing that the Renegade Lord has a powerful will. As soon as you attack, the battle starts to go against you. The power of the will which counter-attacks is awesome and you can do nothing as you lose control of your mind. You can only watch, as an outsider, as your hand pulls the blaster from your jacket. Sweating with effort you vainly try to resist as, shaking wildly, your arm takes aim at Bloodhound. He sees you and draws his own blaster. You are about to shoot him against your will when a blast of white-hot plasma rips into your shoulder. Lose 10 Endurance points.

The arrow buries itself into your neck. You clutch at it and stand motionless. Then your arms go back as you begin to topple from the wall. You are dead before you hit the ground. You have failed.


134
You are half in and half out of null-space. You are able to see through the walls of your Time Machine and even through your own flesh as if they did not exist. You try to switch the Variac Drive on again, but nothing happens. You are caught in a time flux. Unable to do anything else, you look around. You arc hanging in the air above verdant pastures and a wide blue river Before you is a magnificent city, its houses, mosques and minarets surrounded by a high and well-defended wall. Gold and turquoise gleam below in the sun. The pastures and groves are deserted but around the walls is a horde of mongols, beyond count. There are more horses than men - each warrior has a remount. You ask CAIN for an update on the history of this time and place. CAIN chimes, The city before you is Baghdad, on the banks of the river Tigris, in Mesopotamia. The year is 1258 AD and the people of Baghdad have been under siege for some months by the mongols, led by their general, Hulagu.'
The mongols, dressed in furs and leather, look strangely out of place by the warm banks of the Tigris. They wear conical helmets topped with spikes and plumes of horsehair, and strips of boiled ox-hide laced together and painted brightly, affording them the protection of armour without weighing down their horses. They carry curved swords, hooked lances and short bows made of layers of horn and wood. As you watch, some of them show off their skill, standing in their stirrups, drawing arrows from their quivers and firing them at the city walls, all in one swift, lithe movement. They cannot see you, hanging frozen in the air. As you watch, they gather together and the Caliph of Baghdad, Mustasin, walks forward from the gates of his starving city, flanked by faithful retainers. He kneels before Hulagu in a gesture of surrender. Using the external microphone, you can hear what passes between them. Mustasin is clearly petrified and he begs for his life and the lives of his people. The cold, impassive Hulagu demands to know where his treasures are hidden. Mustasin, seeing a ray of hope, tells Hulagu of his hiding place. When satisfied, Hulagu signals to his men, who massacre the Caliph and his attendants. The horrified people of Baghdad make no attempt to close the gates and the mongols sweep into the city like a tide of soldier ants.
You are held in the air above Baghdad for over a month, and in all that time the slaying continues, the bestial ferocity of the Mongols remains unslaked. Only after forty days and the death of 800,000 people does the stench of rotting flesh force Hulagu to abandon the smouldering palaces, mosques and libraries of thedead city. After they have gone you cannot see even a dog or cat moving in the streets - all life has been wiped out. Shaken by the awful spectacle you have had to witness you are thankful when your Psychic Awareness registers a change in the flux of time You engage the Variac Drive once more and this time re- materialiseas planned.

You float down from the Access Hatch, lowered by invisible Tractor Beams. You can smell ozone in the air of the Spaceport. Rounding a bulkhead you come across a refuelling bay and your holo-detector indicates that the Keladi scoutship in front of you is in fact a Time Machine. Judging by its size it could only be that of Lord Kirik. There is no trace of Lord Speke's machine. As you walk through the hologram you are surprised to see water underfoot. Kirik's machine is normally water-filled, a much larger model than your own. Clearly all is not well for, as you look up, you see that his Access Hatch is open and on automatic, for his Mind Scan is not operating and you are drawn up into his machine. The grotesque body of Lord Kirik lies inert across his crash couch, the disc which is his Psionic Enhancer lies in a pool of water at his side. The usually bloated brain-sacs are flaccid and his jointed legs curled unnaturally. Looking more closely you notice a neat circular wound in the middle of one of his brain sacs, still pouring purplish fluid. There is no sign of the weapon that was used to do this. He has been killed quite recently by someone whom he had allowed into his Time Machine. There is no helping Lord Kirik. Do you:

You accept his transmission and he asks you how your investigation is progressing. You reply that it has not progressed far, but give a brief report. Yelov thanks you and breaks contact. You enter a hovcar and lock it onto the trail of Silvermane and follow him. An hour later he debarks at the GalacticTrade Centre. As your own hovcar glides to a halt, Yelov calls you to his office at TIME headquarters, a journey which takes a further fifty minutes.

'Well, well, an upper in the Morgue - hey, those epaulettes have real warp!' says a guttural voice, menacingly. 'What shall we do with the upper, Street'roids?'.
Then a woman's voice: 'I need that pacy helmet, Clone, get it for me?' The whine of the hovbikes increases as their lights are turned off in unison. Your eyes became accustomed to the gloom in time to see twenty or more members of a hovbike gang. Their archaic machines are loaded with rams, sharpened flanges and spikes. The riders' faces are painted silver and gunmetal, their clothes adorned with parts of the casing of various types of robot, hair spiked silver and gold.

He leaps at you as you grab for your blaster and trigger it just in time. A lancing white bolt of superheated plasma eats into the cydroid's chest. Sparks fly and there is the unmistakeable tang of vaporised metals. A nearby Plasma Sensor begins to flash and the siren of a Citpol jetcopter wails as the cydroid buckles, short- circuiting in a sea of sparks, before falling inert. You have been fighting a machine. You examine it, but the damage is too severe for you to gain a clue as to its origins, before two Enforcers alight from their 'copter, pointing their stun-lances at you. 'Let's see your ID.' You produce your ID chip and hand it to the one who spoke, still covered by the other. He clips it into his Remote Access T erminal (RA T) on his arm and a look of disappointment crosses his features, as he realises who you are. 'What's been going on here?' he says.

Bloodhound hurries back with you to your Time Machines, Falcon's Wing and Hunter, and you both set out for the only Timehole on planet Hel, 600 AD, hoping finally to corner the Creche. You may use your Autodoc to restore up to 12 Endurance points on the way. While waiting to rematerialise, you ask CAIN about planet Hel. CAIN chimes: 'Planet Hel was discovered in 2978 AD by Skirrow, head of the Research Section of TIME, during the same voyage on which he discovered Skirrow's World. It is a tropical world with many dangerous predators, and plants which can trap and digest humans. There are no intelligent life forms. The air is breathable.' It seems that planet Hel was well named by its discoverer.
You rematerialise at the same instant as Bloodhound and Falcon's Wing settles slightly, as if on soft ground. You are resting on the top of a tropical rain forest. The tops of the trees are flattened by a mass of tangled creepers which form a carpet so dense that CAIN mistook it for the surface of the planet. Even the weight of Falcon's Wing has only bowed it slightly. You meet outside, on the tree carpet and move towards a Time Machine, undisguised by a hologram, which rests on the foliage a hundred metres away. Your Psychic Awareness tells you that the Creche are inside. As you watch, they begin to descend from the hatch of their machine. You must act quickly. Do you shout

At this close range it is difficult to miss completely and you shear the general in two with a blast of white-hot energy. You have missed the other, however, and he screams the alarm as he throws himself on you, willing to give his life to save his Khan. You have no choice but to order the guardsmen under your control to attack him. While they battle you slip through the door. Inside is a bedchamber, and sitting on a larger litter, swaddled in silks and furs, is Ogedai Khan, still weak from his illness. He looks up, his narrow eyes questioning your purpose, Goldenstatues, chests of treasure and tapestries line the walls. Silk awnings close off the balcony at the back of the room. You sense that your controlled guards will soon be defeated. You do not have much time. Knowing what must be done and hoping to make his death seem natural you place a silken cushion over Ugedai's face and press down. His hands scrabble feebly at yours, but he is too weak to resist. His face turns blue as he dies. Suddenly the door swings open and several members of the Imperial Guard run in and charge at you. You try to dive through the awning to the balcony.

You step into the small hovrail car, secure the bubble hatch and type in your destination and clearance code as the car rises on its air buffer. The acceleration is steady but not uncomfortable and lasts for half the journey, before you decelerate to the Eiget Vault embarkation point. After many changes of direction, occasionally riding above slower moving cars, you leave the spectacular vista of the neon-clad city behind and plunge into the tunnel to the Eiger. Leaving the monorail you walk to the checkpoint outside the enormous plasteel doors where your ID chip is checked and the mind scanner is used to double-check that you may be allowed into the vault. You step through a small personnel door, past two security droids and into the cavern which houses the Time Machines and the research section of TIME. The area in which the machines are kept is partitioned at intervals and you head straight for your own bay. In the centre of the bay which is lined on three sides with racks carrying maintenance equipment, spare parts, the Variac Drive Re- charger and sundry other useful items, lies Falcon's Wing.

You throw yourself behind a plasteel container but are too late. Unluckily for you, this is a very advanced model and the Particle Disrupter catches your side, and uniform and flesh fizz to nothing. The siren wail of an approaching Citpol jetcopter sounds more than pleasant as you wait for the cydroid to appear behind the container. Instead it makes a superhuman leap to the edge of the loading bay and drops fifty feet to the level below, crackingthe streetmetal on impact. Unaffected by the cloud of sparks this causes it disappears into the maze of the city's traffic lanes. You drag yourself to your feet in time to greet the two Enforcers who alight from the jetcopter. There are always two of the City Police, and they both cover you with their stun- lances. 'Let's see your ID.' You produce your ID chip and hand it to the one who spoke, still covered by the other. He clips it into the Remote Access Terminal (RAT) on his arm and a look of disappointment crosses his features as he sees you are a genuine SAT. 'Fun and games on your first day, eh? What have you to say for yourself?' You report exactly what happened and the Enforcer hands back your ID chip, saying, 'A file of your statement will be flashed to your Section Chief.'
The second says, 'I have summoned an ambulance - they'll look after you.' He leaves a Homing Beacon for the ambulance and theytakeoff.Soon,theHealthExecutiveambulanceishovering above you.

You are too late. As your finger moves to the fire button the Corsair ship rakes the envoy's ship againwith its Pulse Lasers. There is a brilliant explosion which fills the scanner screen with light and then you are suddenly engulfedin blackness.

Caught by surprise Lord Silvermane's powerful body falls over your leg largely under his own momentum. With a shout of alarm he turns to look at you only to find your blaster inches from his face. 'With respect sir, I must again ask, where are you going?'
Barely controlling his rage he says: 'I have come for an important document, kept in the safest place I know of here on Earth, my Time Machine.' The hatch opens in response to his mind scanner and he directs you to a document holder. Looking inside you can see that it contains the blueprints of some of the most advanced Rigellian technology together with information which shows that Silvermane is carrying out a technology trade to the mutual benefit of both Earth and Rigel Prime. 'Thank you,' says Silvermane, taking the documents from you. 'I must be at the Galactic Trade Centre within the hour. Your career with TIME has been a short one has it not?' Realising that you will be powerless if your security code clearance with CAIN is stopped you decide to take a risk and tell him of your mission. He listens, at first with impatience which changes to alarm. Then I shall defer court martial, but I expect a full report of the investigation which I am sure Agidy Yelov will commission.' He turns to leave, then pauses. 'Lord Speke bears investigation if I am not mistaken,' and with that he strides to the exit of the Vault. You return to Falcon's Wing. Turn to 119.

Musicians are playing fast rhythmic music and some of the mongols strut around the fire, showing off the splendour of theirleather coats, decorated and lined with fur. Others are still gorging themselves, tearing chunks of meat from whole carcasses with their hunting knives. As the music quickens sorne begin to whirl and leap around the fire, dancing wildly. Opposite you is a door leading outside to the palace courtyard.
There is a wooden stairway just to the left of the store-room door and you decide to climb it, as you guess it leads towards the rooms behind the balcony. Turn to 247.

You wheel your horse about and wishing Bloodhound ban chance head back towards the battle line. You veer right, deciding to begin near Poniatowski and then work your way along to the great redoubt. You crouch low as a cannon ball whistles overhead, bouncing along for three hundred yards before coming to rest against a tree-stump. Every now and then you see a small gap appear in the French columns where a cannon ball has mown down as many as ten men, before losing momentum. But each time they close ranks and charge on. You are approaching Poniatowski's wing when suddenly your Psychic Awareness tells you that a being with mental powers is nearby. Turn to 73.

You reach into the mind of the huge crustacean, Lord Kirik, using your power of Psychic Awareness. With a shock you realise his overpowering thought is one of hunger, but that this is linked to the small seal-like beings captive in his tank. When he realises that you are probing his mind, the waters of his tank start to boil as his pincers thresh in anger. He is outraged; imbued with the deference for authority of the caste society of Kelados he appears appalled at your cheek. Your Universal Translator changes the bubbles issuing from his mouth into the words: 'You inedible prawn!' He surges above the surface of his tank, water rushing in rivulets from his purple carapace, but containing his anger subsides once more, pincers snapping, as he informs the other Lords what you have done. Pilota smothers a smile, the Creche crawl deep into their cocoons, Silvermane shakes his head in seeming disappointment, but Speke shouts angrily: 'I must apologise for the action of this undoubtedly foul- tasting Earther. How dare you? You are risking an interstellar incident.' Turn to 194.

Twin laser pulses cut through space from your ship to the Phocian's. You can see parts breaking away from the hull in the dazzling red light of your lasers. Suddenly, the scanner screen lights up fiercely; you have scored a direct hit on his Power Plant and the Phocian has been vapourised with his ship. You can only hope that his descendants were not to be shapers of history and that changes in the Timelines will be small. You have, however, saved Korakiik, the Keladi envoy and thwarted the Renegade Lord. You try to turn your ship back to the Starport but she is badly damaged. Make a Chance Roll.

You try to throw him over your hip but he is solid and immovable, his powerful blue-skinned frame is many times more powerful than yours, as his race evolved on a high-gravity world.

'I am in a hurry,' he says, controlling his anger, 'on important diplomatic business, but I will make sure you arc demoted for this outrageous assault.'

You have taken them by surprise and they both slump to the floor. You step over them and go through the door. Inside is a bedchamber, and sitting on a large litter, swaddled in silks and furs, is Ogedai Khan, still weak from his illness. He looks up, his narrow eyes questioning your purpose. Golden statues, chests of treasure and tapestries line the walls. Silk awnings close off the balcony at the back of the room. Knowing what must be done and hoping to make his death look natural, you place a silken cushion over Ogedai's face and press down. His hands scrabble feebly at yours, but he is too weak to resist.

You describe the situation to Lynx and tell her that Bloodhound had also been sent by Yelov to kill you and that he is now watching over Napoleon at the hamlet of Shevardino. Your horse has been frightened away and you set out on foot to explore the battle line nearer the redoubts. As you approach, bugles sound behind you and a great charge of French infantry is launched with Marshal Ney at their head. The Frenchmen, singing the Marseillaise, come on shoulder to shoulder, mag- nificent in their blue and white uniforms. You are swept up in the charge and carried forward, unable to do anything against the hundreds of men, exhilarated in the heat of battle. On the redoubt ahead of you, the Russian commander, Prince Bagration, rides out in front of his line of green-jacketed men and salutes the French columns, crying in French, 'Bravo, messieurs, c'est superbe!' As you approach Bagration's men they unleash a hail of musket fire and you take this opportunity to throw yourself to the ground as if dead, and let the charge pass over you.
Afterwards, battered and muddied, you pick yourselves up. You have found no trace of the Renegade Lord and Lynx suggests you return to Napoleon's Command Post at Shevardino in case Bloodhound needs help. You agree and after a short time lost in the fog of battle, you approach the Emperor and his staff. Bloodhound rides to greet you and you tell him what has passed between you and Lynx. Turn to 183.

Acting with the instincts of a trained combateer, you throw yourself through the air, roll, and come up in a shooting position on one knee, both hands steadying your blaster.

You use your power of Psychic Awareness to enter the communal mind of the Creche. Their alien thought patterns are disturbing but your initial impression is one of group harmony. They think a message back to you which seems devoid of emotion: We note your thought probe. Under TIME regulations you arc beyond the parameters of permitted activity. We must inform the other Lords, those who are not we, myself. Their mandibles click and via your Universal Translator you understand that they are informing the other Lords that you have tried to read their minds. Lord Pilota smothers a smile, but the waters of Kirik's tank boil as his pincers thresh angrily. Silvermane shakes his head in seeming disappointment whilst Speke shouts angrily, 'How dare you? You are risking an interstellar incident.' Turn to 194.

Twin pulses from your lasers light up the back of the Phocian's ship. You have hit part of the main drive reactor and the Corsair hangs in space, drifting. Small puffs of flame at one side of its hull show you that the pilot is using the weak retro rockets in an attempt to angle his ship towards that of the Keladi envoy.

By the timeyou recover you have been bound hand and foot and they are examining your blaster and helmet. Powerless without the helmet, you are aghast to hear, as they carry you to the palace, that they regard you as a witch spirit of the Everlasting Blue Sky and will sew up your mouth and nostrils before killing you, lest your spirit escape to haunt them. You struggle but cannot get free. You have failed and the Space Federation will never be.

Your Thinkstrike works. The hussar clutches his forehead and then tumbles gracefully from the saddle into the brook with a splash. As he lies there, spluttering, you seem to see an uncanny resemblance to the portraits of your early ancestors. An uneasy feeling comes over you as you spur your horse on, out of the hollow. Looking back you see the hussar emptying water out of his shako. Turn to 145.

You set your two controlled mongols against the Imperial Guardsman and the general who cry the alarm. You take advantage of the battle to slip through the door and into the room beyond.
Inside is a bedchamber, and sitting on a large litter, swaddled in silks and furs, is Ogedai Khan, still weak from his illness. He looks up, his narrow eyes questioning your purpose. Golden statues, chests of treasure and tapestries line the walls. Silk awnings close off the balcony at the back of the room. You sense that your controlled guards will soon be defeated. You do not have much time. Knowing what must be done and hoping to make his death seem natural, you place a silken cushion over Ogedai's face and press down. His hands scrabble feebly at yours, but he is too weak to resist. His face turns blue as he dies. Suddenly the door swings open and several members of the Imperial Guard run in and charge at you.

You manage to turn the stricken ship back towards the Starport. As you do so you notice on the rear scanner an asteroid mining ship appear from behind the Asteroid Belt, and your Psychic Awareness registers the presence of a being with great powers of the mind, probably the Renegade Lord. You catch a thought, Golden Horde and then, self destruct. To your surprise the mining ship blossoms into a flowering white light, like a star gone nova, as it explodes. Is the Renegade Lord dead, you wonder? It takes all of your skill to land the under-powered Corsair ship which groans and shudders during re-entry but, thankfully, gains the safety of the Starport, after a very hard landing. Wasting no time, you run to Falcon's Wing before Starport Security come to question you. CAIN tells you that he registered a Variac Drive emisson from the centre of the asteroid mining ship just before it blew up. Whoever it was used their Time Machine to wink out to safety.

Your aim was true. A lancing white bolt of superheated plasma erupts against one of the guards. He is blown back against the end wall of the corridor and then slumps to the floor. The second guard runs off as two security droids arrive. You walk up to the fallen man after giving your Security Code to the hovering droids as they aim their stun-lances at you. You identify yourself. Satisfied, they begin to hunt the second assassin. Your fallen assailant is dying, there is nothing you can do to save him. You ask him who sent him and lean close to hear him gasp: TIME Lord...' but the rest is lost in a spasm of coughing as he dies. You may keep his psionic damping circlet.
This would impede your own powers of the mind but may be useful. Note it on your Agent Profile, if you wish to keep it. You head back to the safety of Falcon's Wing. Turn to 336.

Cautiously you descend onto the ooze of the forest floor which is covered with rolling ferns. You cast around with your holo- detector for some time, picking your way across the treacherous ground. Within minutes you have scanned the area of the Timehole without finding anything more than a few giant, black centipedes, a metre long or more. As you return to Falcon's Wing your attention is caught when the surface of the swamp ripples slightly. You cannot see beneath the floating green scum, but decide to hurry the last few steps to the Access Hatch. Suddenly, the surface parts and huge jaws surge towards you.

A nearby outcrop of rock proves to be a hologram. Lord Speke or another traveller in time is here. You walk through the hologram and see a Model B Time Machine, that of one of the human or humanoid Lords of TIME. From the markings you guess it to be that of Lord Speke and, surprisingly, he has left the Access Hatch on automatic, an extraordinarily careless mistake. You are drawn up into the machine and come to rest on the Access Disc. Lord Speke, dressed as a Macedonian soldier, is sitting in his crash couch, examining a Macedonian sword of unusually fine craftsmanship. He has not noticed you. The floor of his machine is strewn with maps, charts and texts in the languages of the period. There is a beautiful wooden display cabinet full of ancient Greek weapons, including a fine collection of swords which appear to be originals, showing no sign of age, as if they had been cast quite recently. His Molecular Converter has not been used recently, despite Speke's clothes. Then he looks up and sees you. You remove your helmet and he recognises you.
'Falcon, you have caught me in the act,' he says despondently. He says he will give himself up and he explains that for some time he has been breaking the First Law of TIME and living as an ancient Greek. He has always been careful not to upset the Timelines seriously, but he knows he has been acting wrongly. His collection of ancient Greek weapons is authentic and he has even buried ancient artifacts in places where he could 'discover' them as archaeological finds in the 31st century. You look into his mind, with his consent, and see that it is all true - Speke is not the Renegade Lord. Tears run down his face as he realises his hobby is over. 'At least,' he says, 'I can say I saw the man whose people thought he was a god.' He asks you how you discovered him and you tell him about your mission. He is shocked by the news of a traitor Lord but offers a few words of advice. 'It is not likely to be either Pilota, or myself - we are both Earther stock and interference with Earth's past might mean that we had never existed!' You thank Speke, but feel obliged to order him to return to 3033 AD and give himself up. Downcast, he assents. You leave and return to Falcon's Wing to continue with your mission. Have you spoken with Special Agent Bloodhound since your mission began? If you have, turn to 338. If you have not, turn to 52.

He ducks and the white-hot bolt of plasma scores a furrow in the shoulder of his Power Armour without penetrating.

You collapse to the floor. If you are still alive, turn to 277.

If you wish to do so you may use CAIN to look at the files on each of the Lords of TIME. Each file has a number corresponding to a paragraph in this book. You should note these down in the boxes provided on your Agent Profile. You may turn to these whenever you are in your Time Machine, but alwaysnote the number of the paragraph you are already at, as no paragraph numbers to turn to will be given in the files. The file paragraph numbers are as follows: Lord Speke: 396, Lord Silvermane: 399, Lord Kirik: 395, Lord Creche 82282: 398, Lord Pilota: 397.

At the top of the stairs is a landing leading to a door with gold panels. A blackened staff with a tuft of horsehair hanging down from its top has been driven into the floor before it.

You guess that this must be Ogedai's room, as the balcony must be just beyond it. You decide to Thinkstrike them both in quick succession. Make a Thinkstrike Roll.

Your blaster emits its lightning bolt of white-hot plasma and Bloodhound dies. Suddenly, you feel the attack of the Renegade Lord, concentrating everything in a Thinkstrike against you. A wave of mental energy flows into you and your brain goes haywire. You seem to feel hot, cold, rain and fire all at once. It is as if you can see all colours at once and myriad voices speak every word in every language you have ever studied. Your brain overheats, literally burning itself out like a faulty electric motor. You are a zombie, incapable of thought, swaying on your horse and gurgling like a baby. You have failed.

249
You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole on Earth, 2700 AD. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and, using your Psychic Awareness, locate the Timehole of Earth 2700 AD. When you have translated this location into co- ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points.
Your external camera pivots, showing a large Starport loading hangar which appears to be completely automated. An Andromeda class Star Freighter of the series commissioned in 2692 AD, to supply the outer colonies, rests nearby, its immense cargo doors open for the robot cranes and packers. A line of the robot packers is quite close to Falcon's Wing which is disguised by hologram to resemble a large cold store. CAIN tells you that you are in the Calgary Starport and that the Star Freighter is the Earth Federation ship Frank Whittle, named after the inventor of the jet engine used in aeroplanes of the 20th century. It is being loaded with supplies for the new colony world of Ascension, in particular the serum which will save almost the entire population from the deadly viral infection which broke out about ten days ago and is ravaging the colony. You can see no sign of Speke or his machine, but it could easily be beyond the Freighter. You decide to check the hangar with your holo- detector and CAIN prepares the uniform of a maintenance technician of 2700 AD in the Molecular Converter. You put on the boiler suit with its markings proclaiming you a grade 3 Robotech, attached, to Calgary Starport. You are walking towards the Freighter, when with a hiss and a screech the boom of a packing robot descends upon you as if you were a piece of cargo. Its huge grab opens - evidently it intends to pack you!

The wounded soldier begins to clamber up to the doors at the back of the carriage. The eyes of the Chasseur, watching you, seem to glaze over and he turns away, as if unconcerned. The ambulance turns down the hill towards a hollow in the hillside and you run towards it. As the wounded soldier reaches for the handle he falls back, screaming, and lies limp on the turf. Do you:

They wear painted strips of oxhide, laced together for armour over leather jackets and breeches.

This machine then winked out, but another has recently arrived. Next CAIN flashes up .1 camera shot of the ground outside Falcon's Wing and you see Special Agent Bloodhound, focussing his holo-detector. You descend to the frost-rimed ground, greeting him. Bloodhound's news is that Yelov summoned him after he had returned to the Eiger Vault and reported you dead. When Bloodhound arrived, Yelov was deep in thought, studying a map of Borodino, a battle that took place on Earth in the year 1812 AD. As the doors slid open to allow Bloodhound in, Yelov had covered the map over, hut not before the agent had caught sight of it. He entrusted Bloodhound with a message capsule, instructing him to open it in the hovrail on his way back to the Eiger Vault and then asked him how it was, if he had killed you, that Falcon had been reported as being alive in Earth's past at the time of the Golden Horde. Bloodhound feigned innocence and threw the message capsule away, after checking it, and finding that it was a bomb designed to kill him. He travelled straight to the time of the Golden Horde in the hope of meeting you and suggests you both travel to Earth, 1812 AD, where there is a Timehole situated conveniently close to Borodino, making it easy for the Renegade Lord to change the past. Do you:

Do as he suggests and go forward to Borodino?
Counter his suggestion and persuade him to come back to Earth in 3033 AD with you to confront Yelov?

You tell Bloodhound that the Phocian pirate guarding the nearest Corsair ship is under mind control. Bloodhound sug- gests that you look into this while he returns to Earth in 3033 AD, and reports to Yelov that he has successfully killed you, so that you can operate without fear of further trouble from your comrades. When he has done that, he will explore the Timelines and help you with your mission. You thank him. 'Good luck and look after yourself, my friend,' he calls, and with that he returns to his machine, Hunter, which winks out suddenly. You look towards the sleek Phocian ships and see the pirate enter one and seal the hatch. As you watch, the Corsair's Fusion Drive fires up and the ship hurtles out of the Starport, breaking the noise and launch regulations as it does so.

If you wish to examine Yelov's file on CAIN's records, when you return to Falcon's Wing, turn to 15.

With a great effort you manage to dominate their wills, holding them under control. You walk up to them and order them to Like you to Ogedai Khan and to pretend you are a messenger. They walk across the Palace courtyard with a rolling, bandy-legged gait and you follow. At the palace door, two more guards stare at you impassively. One of the guards, controlled by you, speaks listlessly at your command. 'We bring a messenger whose message is for the ears of Ogedai Khan and no other.' The door-guards step aside and usher you in. The doors open into a banqueting hall, the walls of which are lined with gold, the plunder of half the world. It is full of mongols, eating and drinking.To your surprise there are no tables, but a great fire has been lit in the centre of the hall. Musicians are playing fast, rhythmic music and some of the mongols strut around the fire, showing off the splendour of their leather coats, decorated and lined with fur. Others are still gorging themselves, tearing chunks of meat from whole carcasses with their hunting knives. As the music quickens some begin to whirl and leap around the fire, dancing wildly. Your guards lead you up a wooden stairway just to the left of a store-room door. Turn to 278.

You manage to wrest control of the ambulance driver's mind from the Renegade Lord and he sets the carriage in motion.

Their mandibles click in agitation and their dull, red, compound eyes stare at you.
They are the six Hiver beings who together are Lord Creche the Renegade Lord. Two are carrying small blasters in the mouthparts and you throw yourself aside in case they blast you. Make an Evasion Roll.

With the lightning reactions and skill of a trained combateer you draw your blaster and fire, just as Yelov was preparing in blast you. You hit him and he is thrown backwards, one arm and leg burnt horribly. He falls down through a gap in the tree carpet and you run to the hole and peer down. His body is pillowed on an eerily glowing mass of jelly, like a giant amoeba As you watch he moves feebly and rolls off onto the leaf mould that covers the ground. As you peer through the hole the darkness below is lit by a faint blue light. Something much larger than Yelov is slithering slowly towards him. Yelov cannot move! Bloodhound cuts a rope from the creepers and you blast the fungoid mass that is moving towards him. It shudders and retracts and Bloodhound risks his life going down to save Yelov He ties him up and you both haul him up to the tree carpet. Y ou carry him to Falcon's Wing and, placing him in the Autodoc, sedate him heavily, before returning to the Eiger Vault. Turn to 420.

262
Before returning to Falcon's Wing you look around the rest of the refuelling bay. Two Phocian Corsair ships, sleek attack craft, have completed refuelling. A Phocian guard stands by the personnel ramp of the nearest ship, a squat humanoid with a brilliantly coloured head, like a macaw without a beak. To your surprise, your Psychic Awareness tells you that his mind is being dominated by another. Since Korakiik is the only known psionically aware Keladi at this time and he is in space orbit, a non-Keladi must be controlling him, possibly Kirik's killer and maybe the Renegade Lord. Before you can investigate, your holo-detector begins to bleep continuously. A Time Machine has materialised behind you. Spinning round, you see a figure seeming to appear from the side of a gas tank that did not exist a few moments earlier. He looks like a Phocian pirate, but on seeing you he tips back his helmet to reveal the face of TIME Special Agent Bloodhound. Like you, he has a model A3 Time Machine, now disguised as the gas tank. His thoughts brush yours and he speaks before you can greet him, his blue eyes hard, 'I'm sorry, Falcon, I have a Termination Order for you.' You realise he has been ordered to kill you, just as he draws his blaster with the lightning reactions of an elite combateer. You dive to the floor, but are wounded slightly as the lancing white bolt of plasma sears your neck. Lose 4 Endurance points. Will you:

Falcon's Wing reaches the surface and bobs gently. Your external camera revolves slowly until a floating platform comes i n t o sight. A hideous apparition of jointed legs and bloated brain sacsslithers over its edge and is lost to the deep. Your exterior microphone amplifies a strange clicking which your Translator reads as, '... unforgivable interruption of Kelcrrrrck'ick by a non-clan member...' Apparently there is no universal equi- valent for Kelcrrrrck'ick. Puzzling as to what you may have Interrupted your attention is suddenly drawn to the screen as the camera tilts down towards the surface, picking up some movement. Through the reflected glare of the Keladi sun you see what looks like a hundred-metre long sea monster with six luminous eyes about to engulf you.
Falcon's Wing lurches violently as it erupts from the water and you realise it is a Keladi spaceboat with its floodlights on, a rakish space ship shaped like a manta ray. CAIN chimes, They are requesting holophone contact,' and you open a channel. You strain back in your crash couch as Falcon's Wing fills suddenly with water and a cruel looking Keladi appears before your eyes, claws waving. Remembering it is only a holo-projection you relax and identify yourself as a. member of TIME, codename Falcon. The Keladi replies, 'It is well I arrived quickly. I am Rrillk, Argon of the TIME research station, here in the Biruk shallows. Had not I, a member of the bond-clan of TIME, arrived first you might have been treated with hostility, even attacked.' You ask where Lord Kirik is, and Rrillk informs you that he is at the research station on the sea floor.
You are towed slowly to the floating platform where you leave Falcon's Wing and descend to the bottom in a lift which travels down a long transparent shaft. As you descend you see various. unusual and colourful sights. A coral-cloud, flapping its way through the sea like a scarlet underwater fern and then a shoal of Gorblefish, rainbow-hued fish with anemone heads. At the foot of the shaft, a man, Garren, is waiting, one of the consultants at the research station. He welcomes you to the air breathing section, a large, transparent dome around which several Keladi gather to stare at you. Garren informs you that Lord Kirik recently travelled into Kelados' past, to the timehole in 2710 AD. You tell Garren that you must follow him immediately and he accompanies you to the surface in the lift As you take your leave, Garren hands you a small container of pills, which he tells you are synthesised from the gills of Skorarli, the sleek predator of the depths of Kelados. They stimulate the reflexes. You thank him and take one before entering your Time Machine. Add one to your Evasion Modifier and note on your Agent Profile that you have a supply of these pills You quickly instruct CAIN to switch on the Variac Drive and, using your Psychic Awareness, plot your course through null space to the Timehole in Kelados' past.

You are acting against the First Law of TIME, but as you step towards the village well, resplendent in your silver uniform with your helmet's reflecting plate pulled down like a mirror in front of your face, the slaughter stops, quite suddenly. They whisper in awe. You point at one of the mongols and Thinkstrike him. He slumps to the ground. Next, you use the mechanical sounding voice box of your Translator to order the mongols to leave the village. Their leader kneels before you and offers homage and the rest follow suit. 'We obey, O spirit of the Everlasting Blue Sky,' he says, and they mount up and ride quickly away. The villagers gaze at you in fear and astonish- ment. Wasting no time, you gather up the clothes and the nuclear bomb and return to the safety of Falcon's Wing, hoping your actions have not seriously damaged the Timelines. You ask C A I N to what extent you have changed the past, and, to your relief, he responds, 'There is no significant change, Falcon.

I he stricken hulk is a sitting duck, your computer is able to target your lasers automatically and you open fire. Twin laser pulses cut through space from your ship to the Phocian's. You can see parts breaking away from the hull in the dazzling red light of your lasers. Suddenly, the scanner screen lights up fiercely; you have scored a direct hit on his Power Plant and the Phocian has been vapourised with his ship. You can only hope that his descendants were not to be shapers of history and that changes in the Timelines will be small. You have, however, saved Korakiik, the Keladi envoy, and thwarted the Renegade Lord.
You turn your ship back to the Starport. As you do so you notice on the rear scanner an asteroid mining ship appear from behind the Asteroid Belt, and your Psychic Awareness registers the presence of a being with great powers of the mind, probably the Renegade Lord. You catch a thought: Golden Horde and then,self destruct. To your surprise the mining ship blossoms into a flowering white light, like a star gone nova, as it explodes. Is the Renegade Lord dead, you wonder? You manage to land the Corsair back at the Starport without too much trouble. Wasting no time, you run to Falcon's Wing before Starport Security come to question you. CAIN tells you that he registered a Variac Drive emission from the centre of the asteroid mining ship, just before it blew up. Whoever it was used their Time Machine to wink out to safety.

This is the first time I've completed a commission given to me by a Lord of TIME,' he hisses. As hegloats a security droid appears, hovering soundlessly behind him, and discharge, its stun-lance. The assassin is bathed in blue light and jerks back suddenly as the circuits in his Power Armour begin to short out Unable to control the armour, which is too heavy to be moved without the assistance of its power pack, he falls on the floor. body arched like a crab, as the armour begins to steam.

You emerge from the greyness of null-space into a huge spaceport on an artificial island, built so that the Keladi could trade with other spacefaring races without forcing them to adapt to an undersea environment. The huge, vaulted Starport stretches for miles on each side; you can count more than forty different types of spacefaring vessels. The holo-generator throws the image of a large aluglass container around Falcon's Wing and the camera shows that nobody has noticed its sudden appearance. You ask CAIN for historical details of Kelados in 2710 AD. It chimes, 'At this moment in time the Keladi are on the brink of war with the Earth Federation. Reason: border incidents misinterpreted by Keladi as being a way of testing their defence systems. The Keladi, at this time, do not realise that many humans break the Earth Federation's laws and suppose that if one human kills a Keladi, his "clan", or all Earthers, approve his action. Phocian pirates are being en- couraged to use Keladi Starports as bases from which to prey on Earth Federation shipping.'
What could be done to change the Timeline here?' you interrupt.
CAIN waits for some seconds before replying: 'I can see one methodof changing the Timeline which would be both easy to do and disastrous in effect. The Keladi envoy, Korakiik, a telepath, regarded as insane and "clanless" by the Keladi, but the only one who, through his psionic power, understands the EarthFederation and humans is shortly due to leave Kelados orbit to meet an Earth envoy. Historically, he was responsible for preventing a war which would probably destroy both civilisations.To prevent this meeting would change the timeline to a greater degree than I can compute.' You find yourself thanking CAIN as you pull on the uniform of a Phocian pirate which CAIN has already instructed the Molecular convertor to prepare. Your Psionic Enhancer helmet now resembles the helmet of a Phocian laser-turret operator, disguising your features. Taking your holo-detector, you set out in search of Lord Kirik. Turn to 360.

There is nothing you can do as the Renegade Lord's mind bends its full power against you. A wave of mental energy flows into you and your brain goes haywire. You seem to feel heat, cold, rain and fire all at once. It is as if you can see all colours at once and myriad voices speak in every language you have ever studied. Your brain overheats, literally burning itself out like a faulty electric motor. You are a zombie, incapable of thought, gurgling like a baby. You have failed.

Your attempt to control his will fails and you are cut down by sword and lance. They leave you to die in a pool of blood, disappointed that you didn't offer better sport. As Falcon, you have failed.

You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole on present day Kelados (3033 AD). Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and,using your Psychic Awareness, locate the Timehole of present day Kelados. When you have translated this location into co-ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points.
The feeling of disorientation when you rematerialise persists longer than is usual. Flipping the switch for the outside camera you are dismayed to see nothing in the floodlight but green fog The machine rocks gently as if the stabilising legs were malfunctioning. With a start you remember that the surface of Kelados is one great ocean. Your altimeter tells you that the machine is floating to the surface, the hull can easily withstand the pressure of water at your depth of fifty metres. CAIN sends a TIME recognition signal to a nearby research station.

Your Thinkstrike works. The hussar clutches his forehead and then tumbles gracefully from the saddle into the brook with a splash.

Looking back you see the hussar emptying water out of his shako. Picking your way through the fog of battle you f i n a l l y come across Bloodhound again, who is pretending to fix the girth of his horse.

Taken by surprise, the general and the Imperial Guardsman are swiftly cut down. You manage to keep your guards under control and order them to lead the way through the door. Inside is a bedchamber, and sitting on a large litter, swaddled in silks and furs, is Ogedai Khan, still weak from his illness. He looks up, his narrow eyes questioning your purpose. Golden statues, chests of treasure and tapestries line the walls. Silken awnings close off the balcony at the back of the room. Do you:

Falcon's Wing reaches the surface and bobs gently. Your external camera revolves slowly until a floating platform comes into sight. Two hideous apparitions of jointed legs and bloated brain sacs slither over its edge and are lost to the deep. Your exterior microphone amplifies a strange clicking which your Translator reads as, '... unforgivable interruption of Kelcrrrrck'ick by a non-clan member...' Apparently there is no universal equivalent for Kelcrrrrck'ick. Puzzling as to what you may have interrupted, your attention is suddenly drawn to the screen as the camera tilts down towards the surface, picking up some movement. Through the reflected glare of the Keladi sun you see what looks like a hundred-metre long sea monster with six luminous eyes about to engulf you.
Falcon's Wing lurches violently as it erupts from the water and you realise it is a Keladi spaceboat with its floodlights on, a rakish space ship shaped like a manta ray. CAIN chimes, They are requesting holophone contact,' and you open a channel. You strain back in your crash couch as Falcon's Wing fills suddenly with water and a cruel looking Keladi appears before your eyes, claws waving. Remembering it is only a holo-projection you relax and identify yourself as a member of TIME, codename Falcon. The Keladi replies, 'It is well I arrived quickly. I am Rrillk, Argon of the TIME research station, here in the Biruk shallows. Had not I, a member of the bond-clan of TIME, arrived first, you might have been treated with hostility, even attacked.' You ask where Lord Kirik is, and Rrillk informs you that he has just used his Time Machine to go back to the Timehole in Kelados' past, 2710 AD. You decide to follow him immediately, and thanking Rrillk for his help, disengage the holophone connection and ask CAIN to engage the Variac Drive. Turn to 281.

Using your power of Psychic Awareness you explore the mind of Lord Speke. He is currently trying to visualise you dressed in the garb of an ancient Greek. Upon realising that you are probing his mind he suffers a flash of guilt and anxiety, but then, strangely, calms his thoughts and sends a message: I put itdown to youthful exuberance, but you should not be behaving in this way. You decide to break thought contact. Speke looks at you disapprovingly. Will you:

Your blaster spouts white-hot bolts of plasma, cutting a swathe through the horsemen. Ten or more perish and the squealing of their horses rings in your ears. Seeing what they take to be evil monk, they turn tail and flee. They are followed by the rest of the horsemen in the village as the word of your evil magic is shouted one to another.
Still carrying,the nuclear bomb, you go back to Falcon's Wing, hoping your actions have not seriously changed the Timelines. You ask CAIN to what extent you have changed the past and to your relief, he responds, 'There is no significant change, Falcon. My files do carry a tale, however, about a sorcerer who saved the village of Ramallo from the mongol horde, for a brief time. Congratulations, Falcon, you are the sorcerer of Ramallo,' CAIN then adds, 'Lucky to be alive.' You tell CAIN to shut up. Turn to 229.

303
You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole in the time of Alexander the Great. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and, using your Psychic Awareness, locate the Timehole of Alexander the Great. When you have translated this location into co-ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points.
You rematerialise and the holo-projector makes Falcon's Wing look like a bleak hillock. Your exterior camera shows a small range of desolate hills giving way to a dry plain crossed by a small river. You press hold and the camera stops swivelling as a small city of mud-baked houses surrounded by tall, white stone walls and towers appears. A pall of smoke hangs above it and the gates have been flattened. Before the city is an army, celebrating victory, amidst piles of booty, in their camp. A stricken figure in golden armour is lying on a litter outside a great white tent, tended by doctors in grey robes. Others, soldiers and officers, stand about him, anxiously.
You ask CAIN what happened here, historically. He chimes, This city is the local capital. The people marched out to give battle to Alexander the Great and his army of Macedonians and troops from other conquered lands, but fled when they saw Alexander and his men. Alexander is returning from India to Babylon, the capital of his new empire and decided to take this city.His men did not want to risk their lives again and he led the assault in an attempt to inspire them. Realising that he was risking his life, his men threw themselves onto the siege ladders, but these broke in their eagerness. Two men only were with Alexander when he jumped down into the city and he was severely wounded before the Macedonians broke down the gates and rescued him, massacring the townspeople in their frenzy.'
'Thank you CAIN,' you interrupt. 'What action would change the Timeline here?'
CAIN says: The assassination of Alexander would seem the most likely option, but I cannot compute the effect this would have on the past. Alexander will die in only a few years from now at the age of thirty-three and his empire will be divided up and fought over by his successors.' CAIN programmes the Molecular Converter to create the dress of a phalangite, a Macedonian warrior, and you step from Falcon's Wing wearing sandals, bronze greaves, a long heavy skirt of boiled leather strips, a breastplate, a small round shield strapped to your left forearm and your Psionic Enhancer becomes a crested helmet covering your face with a Y-shaped slit for you to see through. Unable to wield a sixteen-foot-long 'sarissa' you make do with a shortsword. Your blaster and holo-detector are concealed under your red cloak. You search the hills for Lord Speke's machine. Turn to 237.

304
The ambulance rattles up the hill towards the Emperor and his staff, the horses straining and you all run to intercept it. As you approach it, four Polish lancers, attached to Napoleon's escort, wheel their horses towards you. They look magnificent in their maroon and navy uniforms but their eyes are oddly glazed as if entranced. Their hostile intentions are all too clear, however, as they lower their long lances and charge at you, red and white lance pennons fluttering in the breeze. You haven't much time. Do you:

Throw yourself to the ground so that the horses pass over you knowing that they will try to avoid trampling you?

You are too slow. The Emperor's guard lunges swiftly as your finger closes on the trigger. His sword buries itself in your heart a moment before the white-hot plasma of your Waster causes his own body to explode. You die together and the Space Federation will never be. You have failed.

306
You ask CAIN for information on the Golden Horde. The computer responds: 'The Golden Horde was a name given to mongol tribesmen of the 12th and 13th century on Earth.' Looking at your Timehole map you can see that there is a Timehole on Earth in that period. Do you:

308
As unobtrusively as you can you wander through the camp, casting around with your Psychic Awareness. You pick up a variety of the soldiers' thoughts; some are full of fear at the thought of assaulting the city, others are casting their minds back to their homes in Macedon, more are simply bored, a few look forward to pillage and plunder. Suddenly the mood changes. Alexander has had a priest take the omens and they are not good, but Alexander decides to attack in any case. Anxiety spreads and most are unwilling to attack. The king orders his men to prepare to storm the city and the army organises as if by magic. Siege ladders are brought forward on carts. There is still no sign of Speke and you are curtly ordered to join a phalanx of men near the city gates. Hoping not to be noticed you take your place in one of the columns. Sensing that his men, war weary and far from home, are reluctant to storm another city after the bad omens, Alexander exhorts them to attack. They hesitate and he grabs a ladder and thrusts it against the wall. He scales it quickly, followed by his shieldbearer and a member of his bodyguard, and is soon atop the wall. Seeing this, the Macedonians bring up the ladders and crying, 'Iskander, Iskander!' for that is how they say his name, they rush up the ladders, which break in their eagerness. Alexander, an obvious target, is pelted with missiles and jumps down inside the city, almost alone. Turn to 273.

Since the Phocian is not in control of his own mind he is defenceless against your Thinkstrike and he starts to float unconscious, in his free-fall harness. You free him from the couch and tie him up with the harness before pushing his weightless body back into your ship. By the time he comes round you are on your way back to the starport. As you head back you notice, on the rear scanner, an asteroid mining ship appear from behind the Asteroid Belt, and your Psychic Awareness registers the presence of a being with great powers of the mind, probably the Renegade Lord. You catch a thought: Golden Horde and then, self destruct. To your surprise the mining ship blossoms into a flowering white light, like a star gone nova, as it explodes. Is the Renegade Lord dead, you wonder? Then you notice the Phocian coming round and you interrogate him. Your voice is mechanical, using the Universal Translator, and he readily informs you that his mind was taken over by a very alien and powerful mind, obviously neither Keladi, Phocian nor Earther. He had been instructed to destroy the envoy's vessel. He asks what is happening, but following the First Law of TIME, you ignore him.
You land safely and leave the pirate Phocian tied up in the ship. Wasting no time, you run to Falcon's Wing before Starport Security come to question you. CAIN tells you that he registered a Variac Drive emission from the centre of the asteroid mining ship just before it blew up. Whoever it was used their Time Machine to wink out to safety.

You pick your way through the mass of soldiery towards the large white tent, and are tall enough to crane your neck and see the figure of Alexander, resplendent in golden armour with a battered helmet which sports a white crest. He is a short man, but very athletic, his curly reddish-blond hair framing a deter- mined face with piercing blue eyes. Nearby, a white-robed priest is fiddling with the entrails of a sheep. He looks towards Alexander whom he calls King Iskander and strongly advises him not to attack the town, saying that the omens are bad. The soldiersmutter, but Alexander replies, 'My business is to conquercities. I do not have time to study the entrails of sheep. Leave me alone to finish my business.' Turning to his advisers he gives the word to prepare to storm the city. The army organises as if by magic, and siege ladders are brought forward on carts. There is still no sign of Speke and you are curtly ordered to join a phalanx of men near the city gates. Hoping not to be noticed, you take your place in one of the columns.

Ripping the ambulance doors open reveals a bizarre sight, six creatures like giant ants, mandibles clicking in agitation, are backing into a honeycomb structure, their dull, red, compound eyes menacing. One collapses as the combined force of your Thinkstrike hits home. The honeycomb is on top of a flyer, similar in design to your own and you both throw yourselves back to the ground outside to avoid the Ion Drive exhaust as the flyer explodes from the front of the ambulance. You sense that the six Hiver beings who together are Lord Creche, the Renegade Lord, are flying back to their Time Machine, with one exception. The victim of your Thinkstrike had not reached his seat in the honeycomb. Toppling backward as the flyer took off, it was vapourised by the Ion Drive. Quickly you search the ambulance and find a small capsule. It is in Interstellar Code - a message from Agidy Yelov to the Creche suggesting that if the mission is aborted, they should effect a rendezvous on planet Hel. As quickly as you can, after checking that the Emperor's Imperial Guard are not advancing, you return to your Time Machine. Turn to 161.

The mental effort has made you lose 3 Endurance points, but you manage to keep them under control.

In the hall the dancing goes on and you slip unnoticed out into the night. Outside the city gates you tell them to kneel and then knock them out with a couple of deft blows to the neck; before returning to your flyer, amazed at your good fortune at killing the Khan of the mongol horde and living to tell the tale.

You call up the Free Fall Recreation Centre at Spiro's Ringworld, a massive wheel-like world-in-miniature, orbiting earth. Their holo-coordinator seems to appear in your Time Machine. She is a striking girl, her skin tinted blue with orange flashes. She puts you through to Lord Pilota's personal assistant. He is a bony, hollow-cheeked man, showing signs of the Medawar Syn- drome, the onset of rapid ageing. You identify yourself and ask for Her Lordship and the hologram winks out momentarily When the holo-picture of the assistant reappears, he says, 'Lord Pilota is temporarily indisposed. Under no circumstances may she be contacted at the moment. If you would care to visit Spiro's Ringworld, however, she will be pleased to grant you immediate audience, as she. believes she has some information which may interest you, as an Agent of the TIME Police.' With that, he breaks contact and the blue-skinned coordinator informs you that the line has been closed to all callers and asks, 'What is that weird space ship you're in?'

Through CAIN you order that a shuttle be prepared for your trip to Spiro's Ringworld and waste no time. You run from the doors of the Vault across the launch bay to the small, dart- shaped shuttle with its huge, ungainly drive vents, each as large as the cabin. The navigational computer is already set as you strap into the Acceleration Web behind the pilot. With a flash of light the Ion Drive fires and you are accelerated sickeningly quickly. This is a Navy pilot - she has never flown civilian craft. Minutes later the Docking Computer locks onto the Ringworld, a glittering disc twenty miles across, turning silently in space and the deceleration is equally unpleasant. As you step out into the air-lock, the pilot turns and smiles, 'You stood that well - you must be fit.' You ask her to stand by for your return journey and enter the Ringworld.
Lord Pilota's assistant meets you as you emerge from the air- lock and, helping you into a jet pack, points up into the empty centre of the so-called Ringworld. You are standing on the inside rim of the disc which is rotating quickly enough to produce a gravity not far below that of Earth's. Looking up, you see the tops of the buildings, twenty miles away on the opposite side of the Rim. The assistant explains that Lord Pilota is in the gravity free zone, or free fall area, in the centre of the disc, half way to the other rim. You blast off with him confidently enough, and head for the centre of the rimworld. As you approach you see Lord Pilota, spinning slowly, head over heels, apparently at ease without the hydraulic exoskeleton she uses in Earth gravity. With a shock you realise that you cannot adapt easily to free fall and accidentally cannon into her, sending you both towards the other rim. She steadies you easily and with two deft jet-pack blasts returns you to a stationary position in free fall. She speaks, her voice high-pitched in the thin air. 'Falcon, you've come all this way to see me. Why? What is so important?' Will you:

Her assistant switches on his jet-pack and crashes into you while Pilota moves to the other rim. Two red dots appear ahead of you, growing in size until you recognise their securityuniforms,'The guards obey Remo's instructions to return you to your shuttle or terminate you if you resist, and you decide to obey since you are at a severe disadvantage in free fall. Minutes later you are in the shuttle en route for the Eiger Vault once more and soon back in your Time Machine.

Your blaster spouts white-hot bolts of plasma, cutting a swathe through the horsemen. Ten or more perish and the squealing of their horses rings in your ears. Seeing what they take to be evil magic, they turn tail and flee, leaving the village alone. Still carrying the nuclear bomb, you go back to Falcon's Wing, hoping your actions have not seriously changed the Timelines. You ask CAIN to what extent you have changed the past and, to your relief, it responds, There is no significant change, Falcon. My files do carry a tale, however, about a sorcerer who saved the village of Ramallo from the mongol horde, for a brief time.
Congratulations, Falcon, you are the sorcerer of Ramallo.' CAIN then adds, 'You are lucky to be alive.' You tell CAIN to shut up. Turn to 229.

You haven't long in which to stop the attack. The finest troops alive at this time. Napoleon's Imperial Guard, fresh and eager, will decisively change the course of the battle. The earlier French attacks by Marshals Ney and Davout had been repulsed and the valiant Russian Commander, Prince Bagration, had counter-attacked, but been unsuccessful. His troops were flung back and he himself has been mortally wounded. If the Imperial Guard attack the Russians will be routed and Murat's cavalry will cut them down in their thousands. The Russians will have lost this war and Europe will be plunged into wars against Napoleon for decades. The guards will meet the Russian line in minutes. Do you:

You throw yourself into the mud and fire your blaster at the giant crocodile which is lunging at you. In your haste you hit only its leg and the monster's jaws have closed around you before the sensation of pain reaches its sluggish brain. Powerless to resist, you are pulled below the surface of the swamp, threshing madly. Your ribs crack and you are soon too weak to struggle, drowned in the primeval swamp. You have failed.

346
You lose your grip on the blaster in your haste and before you can recover a lance is buried deep in your chest, the pennant hanging down against your stomach. Blood fills your lungs and you die before the other agents can come to your aid. At least you have led Bloodhound and Lynx to the Renegade Lord, but you have failed.

347
As you gallop away. Marshal Ney orders you to stop and then, realising you are ignoring him, orders three of the young officers on his staff to arrest you. They charge after you and you urge your mount on through the smoke of the French cannon.
One of the officers, a young hussar, whose grey and red pelisse streams out behind him in the wind, has a good mount and is gaining on you. You ride down into a small dip, jumping a brook out of sight of the rest of the army and he follows. Do you:

Ripping the ambulance doors open reveals a bizarre sight - six creatures like giant ants, mandibles clicking in agitation, are backing into a honeycomb structure, their dull, red, compound eyes menacing. One shrivels as the white-hot plasma from your blaster hits home. The honeycomb is on top of a flyer, similar in design to your own and you both throw yourselves to the ground outside to avoid the Ion Drive exhaust as the flyer explodes from the front of the ambulance. You sense that the six Hiver beings who together are Lord Creche, the Renegade Lord, are flying back to their Time Machine, with one exception. The victim of your Thinkstrike had not reached his seat in the honeycomb. Toppling backward as the flyer took off, it was vapourised by the Ion Drive. Quickly you search the ambulance and find a small capsule. It is in Interstellar Code - a message from Agidy Yelov to the Creche suggesting that if the mission is aborted, they should effect a rendezvous on planet Hel. As quickly as you can, after checking that the Emperor's Imperial Guard are not advancing, you decide to follow the Creche. Turn to 161.

You float down out of Falcon's Wing and walk quickly to the adjacent bays. You pass the bay used for the Creche machine first - it is empty. Then you see the powerful, squat form of Lord Silvermane striding towards his machine just as that of Lord Speke winks out of its bay, back into the past. Catching up with Lord Silvermane you ask him where he intends to go. He replies, brusquely, 'I'm on important official business, you need not concern yourself with it. Speke has just left, however, and you may well be able to guess where he has gone, if you examine his file. Goodbye Falcon,' and he hurries towards his Time Machine. Do you:

You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole on Earth, 2700 AD. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and, using your Psychic A wareness, locate the Timehole of Earth 2700 AD. When you have translated this location into co- ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points.
Your external camera pivots, showing a large Starport loading hangar which appears to be completely automated. An Andromeda class Star Freighter of the series commissioned in 2692 AD, to supply the outer colonies, rests nearby, its immense cargo doors open for the robot cranes and packers. A line of the robot packers is quite close to Falcon's Wing which is disguised by hologram to resemble a large cold store. CAIN tells you that you are in the Calgary Starport and the Star Freighter is the Earth Federation ship Frank Whittle, named after the inventor of the jet engine used in aeroplanes of the 20th century. It is being loaded with supplies for the new colony world of Ascension, in particular, the serum which will save almost the entire population from the deadly viral infection which broke out about ten days ago and is ravaging the colony. You can see no sign of Speke or his machine but it could easily be beyond the Freighter. You decide to check the hangar with your holo- detector and CAIN prepares the uniform of a maintenance technician of 2700 AD in the Molecular Converter. You put on the boiler suit with its markings proclaiming you a grade 3 Robotech, attached to Calgary Starport. You are walking towards the Freighter, when with a hiss and a screech the boom of a packing robot descends upon you as if you were a piece of cargo. Its huge grab opens - evidently it intends to pack you! Make an Evasion Roll.

If you are still alive, you force yourself on despite the pain. The cannon continue to roar on both sides, but you arc confident the Renegade Lord is not nearby. Do you:

Lynx crouches, cat-like, and grabs your leg as your boot flashes past her shoulder. She heaves upward and you fall backwards, heavily. Bloodhound attacks her again, but she is able to hold you off for some time. Eventually you overcome Lynx, but not before she gashes your hip with her knife. Lose 5 Endurance points If you are still alive, you take stock of your surroundings. Lynx is out cold and while you were struggling, everybody has moved down the hill towards the battle line. The Imperial Guard are marching to the attack and the ambulance, too, is trundling away down the hill. Napoleon has ordered the attack and the Renegade Lord has changed the past. Turn to 344.

The mechanical packer grabs you. You swing up into the an towards an aluminium cylinder. The machine is apparently going to bottle you, but the cylinder is somewhat smaller than you are and you suppose that both packer and cylinder are stronger than you are. You are held fast, but at the last moment you manage to free your blaster and pull the trigger. The white hot streak of superheated plasma hits the mechanical brain of the packer which seizes up, leaving you dangling helpless in mid- air. The plasma sets fire to the machine and this fire spreads rapidly to a container nearby. To your horror, you see that it is the container holding the vat of serum for the people of Ascension.' Your great-grandfather was born on Ascension. The fire spreads, causing some damage to the Freighter, the delivery of serum will now be delayed by a week. Many thousands will die, including the young woman who is carrying the baby that would have been your great-grandfather. You have never existed. You have failed.

You run up to the ambulance together and, focusing your minds, at a word from Bloodhound you hurl a blast of thought at the mind within. The Renegade Lord has a strong mental power, but at least you have combined your minds. Make a Thinkstrike Roll and add two to the dice for Bloodhound's help.

You rematerialise in the Eiger Vault and CAIN tells you that the machines of Speke, Silvermane and Pilota are also in the Vault. While you are deciding what to do next, blackness engulfs you suddenly. Someone has changed the Timelines and one of your ancestors has been killed before his time. It is as if you had never existed. You have failed.

You float down from the Access Hatch, lowered by invisible Tractor Beams. You can smell ozone in the air of the Spaceport. Rounding a bulkhead you come across a refuelling bay and your holo-detector indicates that the Keladi scoutship in front of you is in fact a Time Machine. Judging by its size it could only be that of Lord Kirik. As you walk through the hologram you are surprised to see water underfoot. Kirik's Machine is normally water filled, a much larger model than your own. Clearly all is not well for, as you look up, you see that his Access Hatch is open and on automatic. His Mind Scan is not operating and you are drawn up into his machine. The grotesque body of Lord Kirik lies inert across his crash couch, the disc which is his Psionic Enhancer lies in a pool of water at his side. The usually bloated brain sacs are flaccid and his jointed legs curled unnaturally. Looking more closely you notice a neat circular wound in the middle of one of his brain sacs, still pouring purplish fluid. There is no sign of the weapon that was used to do this. He has been killed quite recently by someone who he had allowed into his Time Machine. There is no helping Lord Kirik. Do you:

Your horse shies suddenly and a cannonball whizzes past your ear. Looking back you see a French artillery man looking down in amazement at where his right leg used to be. It now lies behind him and the cannonball which removed it bounces onward, its momentum barely checked. There is nothing you can do for the man and feeling slightly sickened, you ride on as he starts to moan. The cannon roar on both sides but you are confident that the Renegade Lord is not nearby.

As you ride along the battle line, the tide of battle seems to be ebbing and flowing. The first attack of the French columns, under Marshals Ney and Davout have been repulsed, but they are preparing to attack again. Behind Ney's position Murat's cavalry are drawn up. You soon catch sight of Murat, the King of Naples himself, the most extravagantly dressed man on the battlefield, great cockades of white feathers adorning his busby. He looks every inch a cavalry general, dashing and stylish with long hair and a sleek look, but he is a veteran of many campaigns. He and his staff are before a thousand French heavy cavalry, the Cuirassiers with their steel breastplates and crested helmets each with its scarlet plume.

You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points.
The outside camera scans the terrain. It appears as a featureless red expanse of desert apparently devoid of life, but with the occasional unusually-shaped outcropping of rock against which dunes of reddish sand are piled. CAIN chimes in with a brief report on the world of Dyskra. The dominant life forms are the Repnids, intelligent beings, a strange fusion of lizard-like skin, tongue and body with a wolf-spider's legs, compound eyes and poisonous fangs, weighing about half a ton each. They burrow through the soft red rock, inhabiting cities and tunnels' underground, heated by the winds of Dyskra, a warm world with few seas. CAIN warns that the predatory Repnids are uncivilised in this era and that he believes there is a high density of life forms nearby. You estimate that it will take five minutes to check the nearby rock outcroppings with your holo-detector to see if any of them are Speke's disguised Time Machine. Do you:

You are forced backwards against the bulkhead behind you as your blaster discharges a bolt of superheated plasma. The Phocian appears to fuse into his free-fall couch, his body distorting horribly; the forward scanner screen is covered with a red film. You quickly leave the scene and return to your ship. You can only hope that his descendants were not to be shapers of history and that changes in the Timelines will be small. You have, however, saved Korakiik, the Keladi envoy and thwarted the Renegade Lord. You turn your ship back to the Starport. As you do so you notice, on the rear scanner, an asteroid mining ship appear from behind the Asteroid Belt and your Psychic Awareness registers the presence of a being with great power of the mind, probably the Renegade Lord. You catch a thought: GoUen Hordes and then, self destruct. To your surprise, the mining ship blossoms into a flowering white light, like a star gone nova, as it explodes. Is the Renegade Lord dead, you wonder? You land safely at the Starport a little while later. Wasting no time, you run to Falcon's Wing before Starport Security come to question you.

You walk along the edge of the forest towards the village; curls of smoke wind up from the holes in the roofs of the cottages and huts. As you approach it, your holo-detector picks up a hologram - a Time Machine has been disguised as trees. Your Psychic Awareness catches a thought as if you have discovered somebody doing something they shouldn't. Abort reconnaissance you sense next. There is a click and a hiss as of a hatch opening and closing and a group of nearby trees wink out abruptly. A metre-long metal canister rolls down from the bank on which the Time Machine had stood. You run towards it and recognise it as a nuclear bomb. The digits on the timer are ticking past, like an old-fashioned 20th century fruit machine. The symbols an foreign but you guess that all of the red stars will be in line within about thirty seconds. The nuclear device appears to be of standard design and is capable of destroying Vienna and most life-forms within twenty miles of this spot. This would change history beyond recognition. As you watch, another of the red stars clicks into place on the DETONATE line. The dials click forward one space at a time and when the middle star has clicked forward three times the three stars will be lined up on the DETONATE line and the bomb will explode.

You walk through the hologram and see a model B Time Machine, that of one of the human or humanoid Lords of TIME. From the markings you guess it to be that of Lord Speke and, surprisingly, you see that the Access Hatch has been left on automatic, an extraordinarily careless mistake. Will you:

You bring the soldier under your control and force him to discharge his musket through a crack in the ambulance's side planking. Bloodhound suddenly tenses, controlled by the Renegade Lord and, drawing his blaster, takes aim at you. You are about to dive onto the ground when the musket goes off and Bloodhound regains control of himself. You run up to the ambulance, but before you arrive the front explodes and a flyer accelerates out of it. Six beings like giant ants, their red, compound eyes glaring at you balefully, are clinging on inside the honeycomb-like seats. One of them appears to have been killed by a musket ball. You realise it is the Hivers, Lord Creche 82282. The Creche skim low through the smoke of the battlefield, almost faster than the eye can see, making a sonic boom like the explosion of a powder magazine, the ammunition stores for the cannon. As they go you catch the thought that they are heading for the planet Hel. Do you:

Try to control Napoleon's mind and use him to call off the attack of the Imperial Guard?

You aim carefully from the shadows and both are felled by the bolt of superheated plasma which seems to leap from your hand One is thrown backwards through the door with a crash and the other screams horribly. A stream of twenty or more guards come running from the building outside which the horses are tethered. Whispering together, they look out into the shadows fearfully. Strengthening their resolve, they fan out towards you in four groups, drawing their swords. You cannot use your blaster in the darkness, for you cannot see where they are. Do you:

You rematerialise in the Eiger Vault. All is as you left it. CAIN informs you that the machines of Lords Silvermane and Pilota are in their bays. Lord Pilota is still on Spiro's Ringworld and Lord Silvermane is in a meeting at the Galactic Trade Centre. Will you:

Your aim is accurate and the mongol's head disappears from his shoulders. The headless corpse takes a few more stumbling steps, the sword waving wildly, before it collapses. Acting quickly, you slit Ogedai's throat with the corpse's sword as the door swings open and several members of the Imperial Guard charge at you. You try to dive through the awning to the balcony. Make an Evasion Roll.

You tell Pilota of your mission and she says, her voice high- pitched in the thin air, 'And I am the prime suspect? I suppose you realise that if a Lastlander such as I interfered with Earth's past I might very well cease to exist. We are Earther colonials after all.'
You reply calmly, 'No, you are not my prime suspect', your voice similarly distorted.
It is difficult to tell under these conditions, but Pilota's dilated pupils suggest she may be using a mild relaxant drug. She continues, however, 'I noticed yesterday that somebody with a high Security Clearance has spent much time researching the history of Earth around the Timehole of 1241 AD. A very great deal of time, according to the Central Library tog.'
Remo, Pilota's assistant intervenes, saying,'Lord Pilota has been under stress, the failed attempt to travel in the future...' He indicates that the audience is at an end. You thank Pilota for her help and return to the shuttle. Within thirty minutes you are back in front of the console of your Time Machine.

Somehow you have only managed to hit the Phocian in the shoulder. His shoulder disappears in a hiss of reddish vapour and his arm rotates gently away from his body surrounded by a cloud of small red globules. Such is the power, however, of the alien mind which controls him that he still fires his ship's lasers, piercing the hull of the envoy ship. There is a brilliant white explosion which fills the scanner screen and then you are suddenly engulfed in blackness. Then you find yourself in a smoke-filled shelter, a fugitive from an alien race on your own world. The past has been changed and your memories with it. You leap out of the shelter to hurl a grenade at a strange alien craft on the street above you... As Falcon, Agent of TIME, you have failed.

393
You follow the figure and as you come nearer you see that his gait is similar to Speke's, but you are not yet close enough to use your power of Psychic Awareness to test this out. Walking briskly, he enters the camp, stopping to talk to one of the soldiers. If it is Speke, he must be fluent in ancient Greek. You soon lose sight of him in the press. The entire camp is readying for battle. The horses are being picketed in corrals and siege ladders are being brought on carts. Some of the soldiers are polishing their armour. Do you:

Head towards the largest tent to find Alexander?

You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole on Earth in the Jurassic age. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and, using your Psychic Awareness, locate the Timehole on Earth. When you have translated this location into co-ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points.
You activate the camera which shows that you have landed in a tropical rain forest, full of giant ferns and primitive fir trees, weighed down with cones. Falcon's Wing settles gently into soft ooze and the holo-projector casts the image of a clump of ferns around the Time Machine. A great swampy lake stretches into the distance ahead. You cannot see any visual evidence of Speke but if his machine is disguised like yours, you realise that the only way of finding it, if it is here, is to take the holo-detector outside. Do you:

SUBJECT:	Kirik
POSITION:	Lord of TIME
SPECIES:	Keladi SPAWNED:Kelados,2956
LIVES:	Kelados Complex, Biscay, Earth

# Personality
Keladi with mental powers are extremely rare. Kirik is looked upon as a mutant because of his powers and is considered 'outside caste', or classless. The metropolitan libraries all carry the rows of books needed to explain the complicated social etiquette of the Keladi. The Keladr see members of all other species, including Earthers, as below or 'outside' caste. The effect that rejection by his own class has had on Kirik is unknown. It is thought that he greatly enjoys his position is a Lord of TIME and hence as a Keladi envoy, as this gives him some standing in his home world. As with all Keladi, he has a voracious appetite and a fiery temper and retains their obsession with etiquette and politeness.

# Homeworld
Kelados. Dominant race: Keladi. Population: 4.357 billion. Habitat: temperate seas. The surface of Kelados is 95% water and intelligent life abounds within the warm seas. Kelados is rich in a great variety of marine organisms.

# Diplomatic History
In 2664 a diplomatic mission from Earth gave the Keladi all the information they needed to become a space-faring race. Since that time there have been no wars amongst the Keladi. In 2710, however, a series of frontier incidents sparked off by Earther pirate ships almost resulted in war, largely due to the fact that the Keladi could not understand that the actions of a few criminals, the pirates, did not involve the rest of their 'clan' - Earth. The envoy, Korakiik, averted war through his realisation that the pirates were 'outside caste', not true representatives of Earth. Lork Kirik, too, understands this difference.

SUBJECT:	Speke
POSITION:	Lord of TIME
SPECIES:	Earther
BORN:	Pacificon, Earth 2887 AD
LIVES:	Alpolis

# Personality
A brilliant scientist, Speke, partly due to his mental powers, was one of two men largely responsible for the invention of the Time Machine. Like many brilliant men, he is eccentric, will not suffer fools gladly and is prone to break off a conversation suddenly, lost in thought. He is a brave man and, with Irving Klimt, undertook the first ever voyage into the past, starting from 2974. They undertook several journeys together, but Klimt never returned from an investigation of classical Greece in the time of Philip of Macedon. Lord Speke has always maintained that he was killed in a drunken brawl, by a soldier, though Klimt had always been careful not to change the past by becoming involved. With the setting up of TIME Speke was the obvious choice for appointment as the Earther Lord and he has enjoyed his position ever since. He is also well known for pioneering work on the mental attack of Thinkstrike, with which he is adept. He is also Professor of Earth Archaeology at the Academy where his specialist subject is Alexander the Great.

# Homeworld
Earth. Population: 43.997 billion.

# Diplomatic History
Earth, as head of the Federation, has not faced a serious threat since the Hive-war in 2934. At this time the Hivers were completely defeated in space, though few landings on their homeworld, the Hive, were successful. There has been peace on Earth for three centuries.

SUBJECT:	Pilota
POSITION:	Lord of TIME
SPECIES:	Earther
BORN:	Lastlanding, 2975 AD
LIVES:	Spiro's Ringworld, Earth Orbit.

# Personality
Set apart by her mental powers, Pilota accepted her position as a Lord of TIME only when a gift of a solar-sail racer was offered if she agreed. She is highly intelligent, but seems not to take her responsible position as a Lord very seriously. She still seldom misses a race and is highly successful in the sport of solar-sailing which takes the courage to make a close approach to the sun and the fine judgement not to go too close. Before joining TIME, Pilota had been on the official list of space smugglers and was found not guilty of tax evasion after an investigation by the Lastlanding authorities. She prefers low-gravity environments similar to those on Lastlanding.

# Homeworld
Lastlanding. Found accidentally in 2571 when the colony ship, Utopia, crash landed on a hospitable, but low-gravity planet. It was the first outer colony. It now has a population of 0.808 billion and still attracts immigrants from Earth. It is a world of golden opportunities and great space, where it is still possible to buy unused land. Each citizen can vote on all issues via holophone in the comfort of their own home. The police force are not kept busy, but Lastlanding has become a bolt hole for those on the run, throughout the Federation.

# Diplomatic History
Lastlanding was a founder member of the Space Federation and increases in importance. As it does so, however, its dependence on Earth dwindles. They now control their own policy towards other worlds.

SUBJECT:	Creche 82282
POSITION:	Lord of TIME
SPECIES:	Hiver
HATCHED:	The Hive, date unknown
LIVES:	Hive Arkship, Sahara, Earth

# Personality
Lord Creche 82282 is a group awareness, composed of six Hivers, These beings pool their minds in order to become a living computer. They have no personality as an Earther would describe it, but in common with all Hivers, would sacrifice themselves for the sake of the Hive, without hesitation. They are properly described as 'it', thinking and acting as one. Response to any question takes a few seconds as each inputs data before there is any reaction. The Hivers pioneered the Federation's studies of powers of the mind, inventing the Psionic Enhancer. They are thought to have developed mental powers beyond that of any other race.

# Homeworld
The Hive. A dry, hot world, its surface dotted with cities resembling gigantic termite nests. Population (estimated): greater than 200 billion. Hiver factory workers are extremely hard working. The first to acquire weapons on their world, they eradicated all other intelligent species.

# Diplomatic History
The Hivers were intent on conquering other worlds at the same time that Earth was building the Space Federation. They were heavily defeated in the Space War of 2934 and joined the Space Federation in the following year. They have cooperated since that date and have traded the life-prolonging drugs which give Earthers a lifespan of 250 years in return for metals.

SUBJECT:	Silvermane
POSITION:	Lord of TIME
SPECIES:	Rigellian
BORN:	Rigel Prime, 2700 AD
LIVES:	Centridome, Asteroid Belt, Sol System

# Personality
Aged, even for a Rigellian, Silvermane is the survivor of a long struggle for power on the world of Rigel Prime. Still fit and strong, he is a shrewd opponent and a pleasant comrade. He upholds the Rigellian code of honour and is proud both of himself and of his race, seeing his role as a Lord of TIME as being to further the causes of Rigel Prime. He has a liking for spartan discomfort which is often thought bizarre by Earthers.

# Homeworld
Rigel Prime is a large, high-gravity world covered by farmland ranges. The population is 30.131 billion. Silvermane's tribe is in power but occasional differences are settled through ritual combat, no longer to the death, between chosen tribal champions. The Rigellians' culture is based upon the code of the warrior and physical strength is still prized.

# Diplomatic History
The Rigellians developed space travel in the 1890s and first contacted Earther spaceships in 2152. There was a long history of minor frontier wars as both Rigel and Earth staked claim to various barren planets useful only for the easily mined asteroids which surrounded them. These were eventually settled after the Battle of The Flying Coffins, notable because less than 10% of the personnel involved survived it. Rigel joined the Federation soon afterwards. The Rigellians assisted the Earthers in the great Hive war and without their help the war might have been lost.

Once safely away from the Time Machine you cut in the Ion Drive and accelerate gradually to Mach 6 with a loud bang as you break the sound barrier. The journey takes just overhalf an hour and you hurtle towards the night sky ahead of you and catch it up. The night is cloudy and dark by the time you have located the city. It is lit by torches and appears to be a strange mixture of golden-roofed palaces, wooden dwellings and mag- nificent tents, called yurts. You land the flyer at the mouth of a cave near the city, don the disguise of a Mongol warrior (prepared in the Molecular Converter), and take the flyer's Homing Beacon with you. As you slip into the city there are sounds of revelry everywhere. You overhear the whispered conversation between the city gate guards. Through your Translator you make out that the celebrations are due to the miraculous recovery of Ogedai Khan, who had been given up for dead.
Suddenly your Psychic Awareness alerts you. The black disc- like flyer, which you saw earlier, hisses overhead, invisible in the dark night. The Time Lord is returning to Vienna and the Time Machine. In the city, there is a sudden clashing of cymbals and a row of torches is brought out onto a balcony high up on the largest palace. A figure appears, flanked by guards, and you hear the cry, 'Ogedai, Ogedai Khan!', go up from the huge crowd gathered before the palace. If you do not kill Ogedai, Europe will be ravaged by the mongols and civilisation as you know it will never have been. As you draw nearer to the palace you see two guards outside its gate. At close quarters you see that they are short and well-built. Dark, slanted eyes stare out from flat, yellow faces, marked by high cheekbones and small noses with flaring nostrils. The greasy black plaits of one of them are crawling with lice. From their smell you guess they do not wash. Do you:

As you turn towards the hill near Shevardino on which Napoleon has set up his Command Post, a group of horsemen gallops towards you. Marshal Ney, with some of his staff, is intent on forming a plan with Murat to combine the infantry and cavalry in an attack against the Russians in the redoubt who are commanded by Prince Bagration. Marshal Ney, 'bravest of the brave', has a fresh-faced look about him, curly hair and curling side whiskers. As he approaches one of his aides calls his attention to a movement of the Russians. Prince Bagration has ordered an attack. Ney reins in and curses and then sends men galloping in all directions. The speed with which he takes decisions is breath-taking. Soon he finds himself without an aide-de-camp to entrust with his next message and, seeing you in your fine uniform, he beckons you over. Do you:

410
You throw yourself to the ground realising, too late, that they can easily pick you off from horseback using their eight-foot- long lances. You roll sideways but one of the Lancers anticipates this and pins you to the turf, his lance entering your body at the kidney. There is nothing you can do and your life slips away from you before Lynx can come to your aid. You have failed, but at least you have led Bloodhound and Lynx to the Renegade Lord.

411
You fail to dominate the French soldier's will and he glares around the battlefield and then shakes his head. The Renegade Lord has sensed your attack on him, and the full force of that powerful mind is turned against you. You are locked in a battle of wills. It is a battle which you are bound to lose as the Renegade Lord's mind is stronger than yours. All of your being is taken up with the struggle when, abruptly, the attack ceases. You shake your head dizzily, but it is only the lull before the storm. A wave of mental energy flows into you and your brain goes haywire. You seem to feel heat, cold, rain and fire all at once. It is as if you can see all colours at once and myriad voices speak in every language you have ever studied. Your brain overheats, literally burning itself out like a faulty electric motor You are a zombie, incapable of thought, and gurgling like a baby. You have failed.

412
As you crouch beneath the trees, you hear snuffling like that of a dog. Cautiously, you stand up ready to make a run for it but, suddenly mongols are closing in on you from all sides. You Thinkstrike two, who collapse unconscious, but the others overwhelm you. They are able hunters, used to the dark and able to track you by smell. You struggle helplessly, but they knock the helmet from your head and carry you to the pond's edge. Laughing cruelly, they force your head beneath the water lilies until your lungs are bursting. Your whole life flashes before you in the slow seconds of your death. You have failed and the Space Federation will never be.

413
Sweating with effort you are unable to regain control of your quivering arm and the will of the Renegade Lord forces you to pull the trigger. The lightning bolt of plasma hurls Bloodhound into the wheel of the ambulance and his corpse slumps, a grotesque travesty of a human being. Your eyes are riveted on the muzzle of your death-dealing blaster as, inch by inch, you are forced to point it at yourself. Your hand is still shaking, but your finger closes on the trigger and the left half of your face and head is wiped away. You have failed.

414
You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole on Earth, 1241 AD. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and, using your Psychic Awareness, locate the Timehole on Earth 1241. When you have translated this location into co- ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points.
The outside camera begins to swivel, showing you the land all around. Behind you is a forest, shrouded in snow, and the hologram generator disguises Falcon's Wing as part of this forest. You are on high ground and to the right you can see a village with a few stone dwellings and many wattle and daub huts, their thatched roofs laden with snow. Ahead, the frosted ground falls away into a wide river valley. The river is frozen over, but you can plainly see its graceful curves stretching to a large walled city a few miles away. Here and there on the plain you can see parties of horsemen riding swiftly. You ask CAIN for some historical information. CAIN responds. 'It is winter, 1241 AD. The city you see is Vienna and the river, the Danube. The mongol horde led by the general, Subatai, has conquered Russia and Poland, and defeated a western army at Liegnitz, before overrunning Hungary. They are a few miles from Vienna, poised to ravage the rest of Europe. Their ruler is Ogedai, son of Ghengis Khan. He will die within the next few days and when the news reaches the Golden Horde, they must, under Ghengis Khan's code of law, the Yasa, return to the mongol capital, Karakorum, to decide who will succeed him. Vienna will not fall and Europe will be saved.'
You break in, 'And if Ogedai should live?'
CAIN continues, The likelihood is that Europe would be overrun and the Timelines changed beyond recognition. Civilisation would be set back a thousand years.' You decide to investigate the area for signs of another Time Machine and CAIN programmes the Molecular Converter to produce the clothes of a Viennese peasant: a sackcloth tunic, woollen leggings and hooded cloak, which you put on over your uniform. You step out into the fresh clean air. Turn to 381.

415
You ask CAIN for information on the Golden Horde. The computer responds: The Golden Horde was a name given to mongol tribesmen of the 12th and 13th century on Earth.' You realise this is a reference to those you saw in 1241 AD. What will you do:

You may lie in your Autodoc during the journey and gain up to 12 Endurance points. Falcon's Wing rematerialises at the same instant as Bloodhound's Machine, Hunter. The digital readout shows the date: 7th September, 1812. You are at the edge of some woods and, once again, the hologram generator disguises the machine in the form of a group of fir trees. The outside camera shows an amazing sight: two colourful armies face each other along a line three miles long. It is early morning, but already the battlefield is becoming shrouded in the smoke of a thousand cannon. You ask CAIN for a historical report. CAIN replies, The French Emperor, Napoleon I, has conquered most of Europe and has invaded Russia with a large army. Today, the Russian commander in chief, Kutusov, has decided to give battle, here at Borodino. The French will win a victory, but it will not be the crushing victory that Napoleon needs to force the Russians to give in before the awful Russian winter kills the Frenchmen for them.' Thanking CAIN for his brief history, you ask him what could be done to change the Timelines at this battle. CAIN responds quickly, 'Marshal Ney will win an advantage for the French, but Murat's cavalry fail to exploit this. Napoleon, unwell, will not send in his best troops, the Imperial Guard, to support Ney at the critical moment. If he were persuaded to do so he would win a crushing victory. The same might occur if Murat's cavalry were used to better effect. The Russians would be forced to surrender and Napoleon would remain master of Europe. In this case, Europe would continue to be ravaged by wars for several decades. Countless more people would die and there would be great changes in the year 3033. I do not have enough data to outline these with any great probability of being correct.' You nod and are preparing to leave Falcon's Wing when CAIN chimes again, unbidden, 'You will remember of course, Falcon, that one of your ancestors is an Aide-de-Camp, carrying messages for Marshal Ney.'
'Of course, CAIN,' you smile and ask him to activate the Molecular Converter. CAIN programmes a uniform into the Converter and you are soon dressed in the most stylish uniform imaginable. A short, white jacket, fronted with gold braid, red trousers with a black stripe down the side, a short black cape trimmed with gold, called a Pelisse, and your Psionic Enhancer has become a bearskin helmet with a white plume. Leaving Falcon's Wing, you are amused to see Bloodhound dressed as lavishly as yourself in scarlet and blue. He suggests that you acquire horses and this you manage to do, finding the horses of some French scouts picketed nearby. Bloodhound shows you a map of the battlefield he has had printed by his own version of CAIN. The nearest troops to you are some French and Polish, commanded by the Polish Count, Poniatowski. As you ride towards the battlefield your holo-detector bleeps. There is a Time Machine nearby. Do you:

Lynx has drawn a knife on Bloodhound and though he is very strong, he is no match for her and is already bleeding badly. They are locked together and you cannot use your blaster, neither can you use your mental powers while wearing the Psionic Damper. You aim a flying kick at Lynx instead but she was ready for you. With the lithe swiftness of a cat Lynx dodges and catches your leg as your boot whistles past her ear. She throws you backwards and you land on your head, breaking the Psionic Damper.

The process of rematerialising in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points. You emerge from the greyness of null-space and, switching on the external cameras, see a huge spaceport on an artificial island, built so that the Keladi could trade with other spacefaring races without forcing them to adapt to an undersea environment. The huge vaulted Starport stretches for miles on each side; you can count more than forty different types of spacefaring vessels. The holo-generator throws the image of a large aluglass container around Falcon's Wing. The camera shows that nobody has noticed its sudden appearance. You ask CAIN for historical details of Kelados in 2710 AD. It chimes, 'At this moment in time the Keladi are on the brink of war with the Earth Federation. Reason: border incidents misinterpreted by the Keladi as being a way of testing their defence systems. The Keladi, at this time, do not realise that many humans break the Earth Federation's laws and suppose that if one human kills a Keladi, his "clan", or all Earthers approve his action. Phocian pirates are being encouraged to use Keladi Starports as bases from which to prey on Earth Federation shipping.'
'What could be done to change the Timeline here?' you interrupt.
CAIN waits for some seconds before replying. 'I can see one method of changing the Timeline which would be both easy to do and disastrous in effect. The Keladi envoy, Korakiik, a telepath, regarded as insane and "clanless" by the Keladi, but the only one who, through his psionic power, understands the Earth Federation and the humans, is shortly due to leave Kelados orbit to meet an Earth envoy. Historically, he was responsible for preventing a war which would probably destroy both civilisations. To prevent this meeting would change the Timeline to a greater degree than I can compute.' You find yourself thanking CAIN as you pull on the uniform of a Phocian pirate which CAIN has already instructed the Molecular Converter to prepare. Your Psionic Enhancer helmet now resembles the helmet of a Phocian laser-turret operator, disguising your features. Taking your holo-detector, you set out in search of Lord Speke. Turn to 360.

Bloodhound suggests that the first move should be to find Napoleon and as you set out with him, towards Napoleon's Command Post at the hamlet of Shevardino, the French troops begin to press home their attack: Davout's infantry, in massed blue columns, storm the redoubt upon which the Russian guns are mounted and Ney prepares to send his troops against the nearby village. Smoke from the guns rolls across the battlefield and the crackle of muskets is incessant. Your fleet horses carry you swiftly towards Napoleon and his staff, who are out of range of the Russian cannon. There are perhaps fifty generals and other staff around the Emperor, many holding spy-glasses to their eyes, the better to follow the course of the battle. In the background is a magnificent squadron of twenty-five light cavalry, dressed in green, red and gold - the Chasseurs a Cheval of the Old Guard, Napoleon's personal escort. You rein in close to a group of aides-de-camp dressed similarly to yourselves, as if awaiting instructions. Your Psychic Awareness cannot find anyone else with mental powers. The Emperor looks pale and unwell, complaining of a headache and as you watch he dismounts and sits down on a folding chair. As he does so, his escorts also dismount and fix bayonets. Bloodhound turns to you and suggests that you go in search of the Renegade Lord, whilst he stays with Napoleon. Do you:

Stay with Bloodhound?
Check out the battle lines and search for the Renegade Lord?

As soon as you arrive back at the Eiger Vault you hand Yelov over to the head of Security and your mission is completed. You return to TIME Headquarters to be debriefed by your new Section Chief, Jobanque. If you did not send Lord Kirik's Machine into null-space, he sends a team to recover it before it can be discovered in 2710 by the Keladi. On your way to your quarters you are told that Agent Lynx has returned safely to the Eiger Vault. CAIN informs you that there are slight changes to the Timelines as a result of your actions in the past, but that these are too minor to concern TIME.
Two days later you stand once more in the Hall of Honours with Bloodhound and Lynx. Lords Silvermane and Pilota sit at the horseshoe table. Lord Speke is not present, having admitted to Jobanque as a result of the interest in his activities your mission has aroused that he has been breaking the First Law of TIME and living as an ancient Greek for sport. Jobanque tells of your heroic valour and the skill with which you guarded history. He has gathered all of the evidence and tells the Lords what has been happening. 'The Hivers had intended to gain power over the Space Federation. They set out to change the past in Kelados but when this was prevented they went back to change the past in two places on Earth, in the hope that at least one would be successful. Straight after your graduation ceremony they examined the chance of using the mongol Golden Horde to set back civilisation on Earth, before travelling to Kelados in 2710 where they hoped to ensure the outbreak of war between Earth and Kelados. Thwarted by you they then travelled to Karakorum in 1241 AD and kept Ogedai Khan alive, using drugs and the Khan's shamans, whom they controlled, mentally. When you killed Ogedai Khan they tried to change history at the battle of Borodino in 1812 and were then pursued to planet Hel where they, or it, died. The Hiver membership of the Federation has been cancelled, of course. We have used the . Mind Probe on Agidy Yelov: he is the traitor working with the Creche who had promised him great power under their rule. As a Siriun, he would have had an excellent chance of surviving a change in Earth's history and the Hivers were to make him Emperor of Earth. He killed Lord Kirik himself, when Kirik began to come close to finding out what was happening. Indeed, Yelov would not have sent Falcon on this mission at all, if I had not received Agent Q's final transmission while Yelov was away, and insisted that he act without delay! Yelov tricked both Bloodhound and Lynx into believing you, Falcon, were the traitor for a while - his deviousness is such that he even tried to convince you that he was loyal to the Federation right at the last moment by turning on the Creche!'
Silvermane shakes his head and says, 'How is it that Yelov ever came to be head of the Special Agents?'
Jobanque shrugs and says, 'He is a deadly combateer and a clever trickster. Only a very evil man could have escaped detection ...'
'And only an agent of Falcon's talents could have defeated both him and the Renegade Lord,' says Pilota and she asks you to step up to her for the presentation of the Golden Wings, the highest honour the Space Federation can give.
Jobanque says, 'I thank you, Falcon, everybody in the Space Federation owes their lives to you.'
