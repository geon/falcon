<p>Instead of asking you to help with the bodies of the Hivers, Yelov swings up his blaster and fires. He is very quick and his aim is true. You are hurled backwards and find yourself, badly wounded, falling through a gap in the foliage to the leaf mould which covers the ground below. Seconds later, Bloodhound falls a few yards away from you. He is unconscious. One of the trees seems to bend slightly above him. Suckers which sprout from its trunk begin to converge on him slowly. They wrap around him and he begins to dissolve. You too are caught by tentacles and you hear Yelov's laughter deadened by the foliage as you succumb to the man- eating tree. You have failed.</p>
