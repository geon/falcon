<p>You manage to wrest control of the ambulance driver's mind from the Renegade Lord and he sets the carriage in motion. One of the wheels strikes a boulder and the ambulance tips over onto its side, and almost rolls down the hillside. The doors at the back open and you see six creatures, like giant ants. Their mandibles click in agitation and their dull, red, compound eyes stare at you.</p>
<p>They are the six Hiver beings who together are Lord Creche the Renegade Lord. Two are carrying small blasters in the mouthparts and you throw yourself aside in case they blast you. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
