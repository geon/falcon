<p>You step from the pedway at an interchange but dart into a | construction tunnel leading down to Old Geneva on the lower levels. As you emerge into the low-life area of the city the stench of sewers bathes you. The dark, squat buildings are made of old- fashioned concrete, a few even are of bricks, which you have only seen before in architectural museums. The Enforcers of Citpol seldom penetrate to these depths, preferring to leave the lowlifers to their own devices. There are no pedways or Plasma Sensors down here, just graffiti and cracked tarmac. You plunge into a blank-eyed crowd of leisure zombies, milling around the sim-combat booths, unnoticed, and unfollowed. You search for a different way back to the upper levels. Turn to 146.</p>
