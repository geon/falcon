<p>You swerve away and the spiked body sails past you. Baal howls angrily, scooping up another corpse. Just then a troop of redfurred Warriors charge into the room and straight at Baal, led by two of the rebel Nobles, still trying to defeat the intruder, Baal. They use their laser pistols on him as the Warriors launch themselves into the attack. You make it to the exit and sprint down it. Baal's bellows of rage fill the cavern. You know it will only be a matter of minutes before Baal has dealt with the Cavers and is hot on your trail. Turn to 204.</p>
