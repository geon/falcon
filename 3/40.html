<p>You emerge from Providence Airlock and walk into the city of Refuge. Catching a hovbus you head back to the warehouse. A quarter of an hour later, you step off the hovbus near the warehouse. As your foot hits the ground, four black-robed figures, waiting at the entrance to the warehouse, charge at you without hesitation and in silence, drawing long, wickedly curved daggers. You barely have time to act. Instinctively, you hurl yourself, rolling, at their feet, hoping to trip them and run on, to the safety of Falcon's Wing. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
