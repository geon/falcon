<p>You move towards the officer and he puts you in the front line, giving you a musket and staring at you suspiciously. Then a man in a smart grey uniform with yellow piping rides up, accompanied by several aides. He seems to be giving orders to the officer. One of the men says: That's Jubal Early, our divisional commander, I betcha we're going in to the attack.' </p>
<p>Then a bugle sounds and the officer shouts, 'Over the wall, men, and at 'em!' A loud cheer goes up, accompanied by a strange whooping and soon you are charging over the wall and into the open. 200 yards ahead is a small river, Union troops are pulling back across it. In front of them are a line of logs, carts and the like, behind which a row of Union troops are waiting. The small river disappears in the heavy wood that blankets Culp's Hill. It is quite exhilarating as you sprint onwards, the men all around you cheering wildly. Then there is a loud crackling sound all along the Union line, as they unleash a volley of musket fire. Men to the left and right of you drop like sacks of coal, but you are pushed on from behind. A little later they open fire again. Make a Chance Roll.</p>
