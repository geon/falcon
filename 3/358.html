<p>'What in the galaxy was that thing?' says McReady. Caleb points to an insignia still visible on the clothing sticking to the burning mass. In an incredulous tone, he says, 'It was Tsu Tsang,' you say breathlessly, explaining what had happened to her. 'Whatever it was in the egg must have been still alive somehow.' They are stunned into silence for a moment.</p>
<p>Bragg says, 'It must be able to replicate the genetic pattern of whatever it absorbs, mimicking its victim precisely. It can change its form at will, obviously, and it can act in separate units, judging by the severed leg. Presumably its cells can reproduce themselves at an alarming rate.' He pauses for a moment. 'That means it or other parts of it could still be alive, somewhere. In fact it could even be one of us, it's had plenty of time to absorb and duplicate somebody since we've been asleep.'</p>
<p>'Oh wow, man,' whimpers McReady, his eyes darting from face to face, Achov's brow furrows, his yellow eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>Caleb grunts, 'Not Lieutenant Falcon anyway,' he says. 'It just tried to kill him.' The flames begin to peter out, leaving charred remains.</p>
<p>'At least we know it can be killed with fire,' says Bragg. 'Right, everyone into the Rec Room, let's get out of this stinking hole,' and he turns to McReady. 'Go to the radio room and contact the communication satellite, tell 'em to get some troopers down here and a relief ship, fast! Achov, go to stores and get the flamethrowers we use for clearing ice off the Dome. See you in the Rec Room in a few minutes.' Turn to 355.</p>
