<p>You step out into the tavern, Rack detector in hand. Some Burrowers turn to you but then continue their excavation - too stupid to react to your presence. You set up the ancient tripod and it glows brightly, which disturbs the Burrowers. Your Psychic Awareness tells you it has located a section of the Rack. Quickly you replace the tripod in Falcon's Wing and hurry down the tunnel leading out of the cavern in search of the Rack Segment. Turn to 29.</p>
