<p>You manage to take control of two of their minds with relative ease and you force them to attack their fellows. Instantly carnage ensues. Your two Warriors are cut to shreds, but not before they have claimed the life of one other warrior. The last two rush at you. You must try to avoid their first attack so you can get a shot in with your blaster again. Make an Evasion Roll as they slash at you with their natural arsenal of weaponry.</p>
