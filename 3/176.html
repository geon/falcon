<p>You try to catch the arm holding the knife, but you just miss. You twist aside, but the knife slides across your ribs. Lose 8 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you catch your opponent's hand as he tries to pull it back and deliver a quick sharp blow to the bridge of your assailant's nose, and whilst he stiffens in agony, throw him into the other dustwhaler. They both collapse into a heap and" you sprint away, losing them amongst the mounds of crates and equipment piled in the wharf. You return to Falcon's Wing where you decide to wait until the Winged Demon has left on another whaling expedition, so you find another ship. You instruct CAIN to disguise Falcon's Wing as a pile of whaling equipment to avoid the prying eyes of anyone in search of the scientist's diving bell. You may lie in your Autodoc if you wish, and gain- up to 6 points of lost Endurance. Turn to 342.</p>
