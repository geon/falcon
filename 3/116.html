<p>A musket ball thuds into your chest near the right shoulder. The impact, like a physical blow, throws you backwards to the ground. Lose 14 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you lie hidden in the long grass gritting your teeth in pain. You can hear the repeated volleys of musketfire from the Union lines and the shrieks of the wounded and dying as the Confederates press home their attack. After they have gone, you risk a look. A brief hand-to-hand struggle ensues and then the blue coats fall back, the Confederates too exhausted to pursue for now. Suddenly, a movement catches your eye and a section of wood just disappears. Your holo-detector no longer registers another Time Machine. It looks like Yelov has escaped. You make your way to Benner's Hill where you are pleased to see Lynx waiting for you. 'I stopped his attempt on Ewell,' she says despondently, 'but I couldn't stop him reaching his Time Machine. I was hoping you'd be there.' You tell Lynx what happened. 'Lucky to be alive, as usual, eh, Falcon? Anyway I must try to find him again. Thanks and good luck with the Baal mission.' Turn to 333.</p>
