<p>You twist to the side but the laser beam drills into your battlesuit. Subtract 1 from your battlesuit armour points, but you are unhurt. To your horror you realise it has damaged your environmental control unit. If that should fail, your suit will be unable to maintain any heat and you will freeze to death in seconds in this cold. Your rocket surges towards its target. Desperately, the creature tries to dodge it, but the rocket homes in and explodes, smearing the powersuit and its contents across the ridge, where it freezes instantly, completely inert. All that is left is a broad red stain, frozen solid. Exhausted, you pick yourself up and use your jets to fly back to Falcon's Wing. Turn to 262.</p>
