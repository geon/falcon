<p>You invade the mind of one of the Nobles and wrest control of it. You force it to turn its laser on another Noble, burning a neat hole through its chest, but the other sees this and, trilling in surprise, opens fire and kills the one you are controlling. You experience the horror of a death by proxy as the mind under your control slips into oblivion. Recovering, it is an easy matter to pick off the last confused Noble with your blaster. The rebels will soon be overwhelmed, especially as their Warrior reserves will be unable to act without orders from the Nobles. You head towards the tunnel when your foot nudges something on the floor. It is a Warrior's severed hand, more like a short sword than anything else. Picking it up, you put it in one of your suit pouches. Turn to 128.</p>
