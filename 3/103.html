<p>You edge your way to the left, changing your jacket, and then rise to your feet. Just then you hear a loud cheering and a strange whooping and a horde of Confederate soldiers appear behind you, in a full-blooded charge at the Union lines. Desperately you run forward. Some of the blue coats are shouting: 'Come on, you can make it!' Then an officer shouts, 'Down man!', instructing you to drop. There is a crackling sound along the Union line which is instantly wreathed in smoke, as they unleash a volley of musket fire. The front line of the Confederates stops as if it had run into a brick wall, but the others push on. You are trapped between the volleys of the Union soldiers and the charging infantry, and are forced to crawl forwards. However, the line of Confederates pass over you, and you are bayonetted to death, almost as an afterthought.</p>
