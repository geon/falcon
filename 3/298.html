<p>You can hardly miss such a large target. You pour a sustained blast of superheated plasma into the pale creature and it roars in pain. Then the blubbery mass of the Mother begins to dissolve before your very eyes, seemingly metamorphosing. Seconds later, Baal stands in the Mother's place, bellowing in anger. With a flash of insight, you realise he has been posing as a Cave . Mother using his hallucinatory mind-powers, but your concentrated blast of plasma, whilst it has not harmed him seriously, has prevented him from maintaining the illusion. At this, the Nobles order the Warriors to halt and begin trilling agitatedly amongst themselves. They know they have been tricked into rebelling against their rightful Mother and they see Baal as an intruder now. Taking this opportunity, you sprint for the door. However, Baal, furious, screams, 'You have meddled in my plans too often, mortal. Your puny little organisation can never hope to defeat me, Baal, the Lord of Flies!' and the sound echoes around the chamber so that you can almost feel the floor reverberating. Then he points at you, and a yellow bolt of energy forks from his finger, crackling through the air toward you. You must try to dodge the attack. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
