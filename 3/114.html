<p>[Score an S]</p>
<p>You draw your blaster and fire at the disciple of Baal. He is completely surprised and you cannot miss at this range. A river of superheated plasma ploughs into him, burning away his head and shoulders in seconds. The other gives a howl of fear, runs, and is soon lost in the port. You return to Falcon's Wing where you decide to wait until the Winged Demon has left on another whaling expedition, then you can find another ship. You instruct CAIN to disguise Falcon's Wing as a pile of whaling equipment to avoid the prying eyes of anyone in search of the scientist's diving bell. You may lie in your Autodoc if you wish, and gain up to 6 points of lost Endurance. Make a Chance Roll.</p>
