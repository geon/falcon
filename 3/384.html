<p>A bolt of superheated plasma shoots into the writhing hole of what was Tsu Tsang's chest with a blinding flash, hurling the creature backward. It crashes to the floor and erupts into flames. Threshing wildly about, it roars in pain, bits of flaming flesh popping and spluttering. A leg, still human in form, rolls away twitching. You watch incredulously as six jointed insectoid legs sprout from either side of the leg, cracking outwards to the floor, and the foot mutates, lengthening and splitting open to reveal rows of teeth, forming some kind of malformed crocodile head. Just then the door slams open and the rest of the mining crew, headed by Bragg, come in. They stop horrified at what they see, babbling incoherently. McReady leans away and is violently sick. The crocodile insect scuttles toward you and leaps. You are about to blast it when Bragg fires a laser pistol neatly dissecting it. Both halves hit the floor and begin to inch together, a tentacle whips out joining the two sections. Bragg stands astonished, unable to act. Quickly you bathe it in plasma and it starts to burn. The lab begins to fill with acidic smoke. Turn to 358.</p>
