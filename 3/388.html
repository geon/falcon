<p>You dart into the lift and press the button for the Mining Control Room. The lift begins to move. Suddenly it shudders for a second but starts to rise upwards quickly again. Then your radio crackles and Bragg's voice comes out of it: 'It's clear in the storage area. How about you, Lieutenant Falcon?' You tell him what's happened, leaving out any mention of the Rack. He replies: 'You fool! You could've been killed!' Before he can go on, Achov's voice cuts in over the radio. 'I've found the suit computer control chips! They were in the main generator room. I'm coming out now, I'll meet you at the corridor junction.' A few minutes later the lift comes to a stop. Do you have Caleb's flamethrower? If you do, turn to 200. If you do not, turn to 302.</p>
