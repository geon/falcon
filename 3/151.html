<p>You step out into a large excavated area, shored up with steel girders. Tunnels lead off in many directions, huge juggernaut machines are lying about, currently idle. They are of all shapes and sizes, huge drills, great caterpillar treads, wheels, jointed mechanical legs, containers and so on. It is lit by enormous banks of lamps. Monorails lead off into each tunnel, presumably to the titanium faces. You board a monorail car and drive it down the most recently excavated tunnel. It is as silent as a grave, save for the low thrum of the monorail car's electric motors. The car hums to a halt in a massive natural cavern of seamed rocks, lit by the headlamps of two drilling machines. In the centre lies a black stone altar. On it lies a translucent white triangle dimly pulsing with light. Slowly you get out of the car, your spine tingling, suspicious of the quiet emptiness. You edge forward to the altar, grab the fourth part of the Rack and dart back to the car. You get it and drive back. You are walking towards the lift when a dull thud comes to your ears from the darkness of an empty titanium container. Suddenly, a formless mass of flesh shoots out of the container, telescoping out towards you, dripping viscous slime and a fetid stench washes over you. Two stalks rupture up out of the mass, black glinting eyes forming that fix their gaze upon you. There is a deafening bubbling hiss, and the rest of the creature, a large mass of writhing tentacles, bursts out of the container. It splits open and a column of flesh rears up, towering above you. At its top rests a hideously twisted human head, McReady's. Then the column splits open with a vile smacking sound and a long snake-like neck comes out, a predatory-looking mouth opening at its end, teeth glistening wetly. Once again you are transfixed with horror, it is as if the creature projected fear in some kind of mental attack. Make a Power of Will Roll as you try to force yourself into action.</p>
