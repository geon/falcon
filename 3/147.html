<p>Bragg and Achov, a tool box in his hand, are waiting for you at the corridor junction. The tool box contains the suit computers and you take your battlesuit control unit. Achov eyes you silently. Bragg asks you what happened and you explain everything to him. Achov says he is going to repair the suits and sets off to the airlock. Bragg nods tiredly, 'Wellit's sealed in the mine, if it's still alive. All we have to do is wait for the relief ship now.' Suddenly, an alarm bell rings out, echoing around the Dome. 'Somebody has left the outer airlock door open!... It must be Achov! Quick, to the suitroom,' cries Bragg and you run down the corridor. Reaching it you discover that one powersuit is missing and the rest have laser beam holes neatly drilled into their face plates, all useless. However your battlesuit is intact its face plate is of toughened pastiglas, proof against laser fire. 'It's not Achov at all!' says Bragg. 'The creature must have got him, and it's gone outside. There's no telling what damage it can do to the Dome from outside with a laser weapon! Our only chance is for you to go outside and kill it, Lieutenant. You should have a good chance in your scoutsuit.' Knowing that you won't be returning to the Dome, you tell Bragg to lock himself in a Titanium Container with enough heating and food to last him until the relief ship arrives. 'In case I don't make it Brax,' you say. He nods and says, 'Okay Lieutenant, good luck. Finish that thing once and for all and let this nightmare end.' Quickly you repair your battlesuit and put it on, the Rack safe inside it, You say goodbye to Bragg and he shakes you by the hand. You wait until he is safely out of the way, then open the air-lock door. A rush of freezing ammonia-ridden gas swirls in and you quickly seal the air-lock, closing the outer door. You find yourself on the bleak surface of Chill once more. It is day time and the weather is good in so far as there isn't a storm. The visibility is reasonable under the slate grey sky. You realise you did not sleep at all last night. Will you:</p>
