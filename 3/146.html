<p>Concentrating hard, you project the force of your will into the mind of the fly-being. Its mind is a confusing swirl of alien thought patterns, so different that it almost unhinges your mind. However, it seems the creature is under some kind of control, nothing like the mental domination you are familiar with, rather some kind of binding that has been upon the fly-being for centuries beyond reckoning, something which you are unable to affect. Hastily you withdraw your mind as it swoops closer. You have only a moment. Judging its mind as too alien to be affected by a Thinkstrike, you go for your blaster. Turn to 160.</p>
