<p>As silently as you can you stalk the Rigellian warrior. However, you are unable to move as quickly as you would normally under this gravity, and the warrior senses you. He spins and hurls a viciously barbed sphere in one motion. You are unable to throw yourself aside and it slams into your shoulder with superhuman force, knocking you to the ground. Desperately, you struggle to your feet but he is upon you. In a flash he has struck your head from your shoulders. You have failed.</p>
