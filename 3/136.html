				<p>136</p>
<p>Moving fast, you deliver a short kick at one of your assailants' knee caps, spinning him to the floor. You are battling with them when Captain Cresap Ord and several men burst in. Your assailants are overwhelmed and tied up. Captain Cresap Ord asks you why they attacked you but you pretend complete ignorance. He eyes you suspiciously for a moment and then orders that the three men be locked in the brig. Then he wishes you goodnight and advises you to lock the door. The rest of the night passes uneventfully. Turn to 106.</p>
