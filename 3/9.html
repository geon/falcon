<p>You instruct CAIN to link up with the Eiger Service computer to check for any news. CAIN chimes: 'Incoming holo-message Falcon.'</p>
<p>Agent Bloodhound's face seems to come alive inside Falcon's Wing. He nods a greeting at you: 'On line, Falcon. How's the mission going? A tough one this, eh? Anyway, I have an important message for you. We've picked up some strange disturbances only a quarter of an hour ago in the timelines of the timehole on Dustbowl. I've just returned from a routine check there. Something appeared and then left the Dustbowl timehole within a space of about one hour. It caused a disturbance in the Winds of Time that is completely unlike anything previously recorded and was of great power. Monitoring is sure it was not a Variac Drive emission. It could be Baal. Something else has come up too, Falcon. A new timehole has appeared in the Planet Cave, in 432 AD. As routine, an agent was sent to establish a monitoring device. They sent the new agent, Kingfisher, on this mission, thinking it was a good training run. Unfortunately, he never came back. The young novice has been killed. Also, the present-day Queen of Cave, has asked the TIME executive for help. It seems there have been some disturbances in their past. Someone or something is up to no good there Falcon. Anyway, that's all. I'll hope to see you soon in the Rec Centre. Good luck.'</p>
