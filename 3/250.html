<p>Bragg speaks, 'Right, it's it or us. We've got to hunt it down and kill it, if we just wait it'll come for us in our sleep or individually.'</p>
<p>'I'm all for getting it now!' Caleb says aggressively.</p>
<p>'I agree,' says Bragg. 'Let's go and get the powersuits, Lieutenant Falcon's battlesuit will be a great asset.' You all leave together, headed for the air-lock strong room. Unfortunately, you discover all of the powersuits, including your battlesuit, have had their central processing units ripped out. Achov rifles through the emergency spares box, 'Damn, the spares are gone too!' The suits are useless without their computers to guide them. You won't be able to leave the Dome until you find, the suits' computer cartridges.</p>
<p>Bragg says: 'We'll just have to do without them. We'll flush it out: Achov you take the right corridor. Lieutenant, you take the centre corridor, but don't descend into the mine itself, that would be too dangerous if it's there. I'll take the left tunnel. We'll each take a short range radio on the same frequency. At the first sign of trouble, pull back to the junction and radio for help. Caleb can stay at the junction ready to move to anyone's aid.' Bragg hands out the radios and you are given a flamethrower to use. 'If we don't find it, then it's in the mine itself. We'll all go down then and flush it out.' As you all head down the corridor you nip into your cabin. Quickly you take out the tripod and search for the Rack. You discover that it has been taken back to the Cavern at the end of the mineshaft. You will have to go down there after all despite Bragg's warning. Turn to 412.</p>
