<p>Later on that evening, you step out to reconnoitre the quayside. It is dark now and the port is dimly lit. You are walking along the wharf when suddenly you are bathed in a mass of bright lights and a voice booms at you through a megaphone, 'Okay Offworlder, lay your energy weapon in front of your feet and lie down. This is the police!' Narrowing your eyes against the glare, you can see a number of figures in red robes covering you with Las-rifles. You realise you have no choice, and you have to surrender. You are booked for murder and for possessing an energy weapon. There is nothing you can do to escape your fate as you are never given an opportunity to use your mental powers. Justice on Dustbowl is harsh, you are sentenced to be executed in the Las-chair and the sentence is duly carried out. You have failed.</p>
