<p>You set the co-ordinates for Rigel Prime, 1642 AD and instruct CAIN to use the Variac Drive. Moments later your mind is searching through null-space for the psychic pattern that marks the timehole and soon you are guiding the navigational computers to Rigel Prime. You rematerialise safely and your cameras reveal a strange wooded glade. The sky is a deep yellow colour. The ground is covered in a close knit layer of spongy turquoise grass. There are trees, odd mounds, some two or three feet high, with thick trunks, sprouting heavy branches laden with fat blue leaves. You are in a depression in the ground. The rim of the glade is covered with trees, so that you cannot see beyond it. You ask CAIN for an historical update. It chimes: 'Lord Silvermane of TIME is of course a Rigellian. But Rigel Prime in 1642 AD was a much less civilised place. Technology is low. Politically, the planet is divided into groups of family clans, corresponding to the nations of ancient Earth. The hierarchy of society is almost completely based on a warrior code of physical prowess. Those victorious in combat, male or female, will be the rulers. It is a very violent society. However, sensibly, mass wars are never fought. The concept of the honourable duel is very important to the 17th century Rigellian. Differences between clans are settled in the arena, usually an expanse of land containing many types of terrain in which specially selected teams duel to the death. The atmosphere of Rigel Prime is sufficiently Earth-like for you to breathe, however its gravity is twice that of Earth. I doubt you will be able to withstand the discomfort for long, Falcon. I have disguised Falcon's Wing as a clump of indigenous vegetation.'</p>
<p>'What about a disguise for me, CAIN?' you ask.</p>
<p>'Well, Falcon, due to the enormous size of the Rigellians you will have to masquerade as a child. As you know, Rigellians are blue in colour, but you could pass yourself as an apprentice apothecary or Rigellian medic. They were known to wear masks and to be fully clothed.' Soon you are dressed in bright scarlet and green with a full face helmet upon your head, concealing your features. A long dagger is strapped to your right thigh and a broad, slashing blade hangs at your belt. It seems even Rigellian medics expect to fight. Taking up the tripod detector, you leave Falcon's Wing. Turn to 67.</p>
