<p>You set co-ordinates for the Eiger Vault and soon you are moving through null-space. You may rest in your Autodoc during the journey and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance. Soon you are in your bay at the Eiger Vault and you ask CAIN to link up with the Eiger service computer to check for any new information that may be available. CAIN chimes: There is a report from the Monitoring section, Falcon. A new timehole has appeared on the planet Cave, in 432 AD. As routine, an agent was sent to establish a monitoring device. They sent the new agent, Kingfisher, thinking it would make a good training run. Unfortunately, he never came back. The young novice was killed. Also, the present Queen, or Mother, of Cave has asked the TIME executive for help. It seems there have been some disturbances in their past.' Where will you go to:</p>
