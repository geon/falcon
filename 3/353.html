<p>When you rematerialise, all the camera reveals is a dirty white expanse, tinged with pink, visibility is almost zero. You have arrived in a storm and sheets of hail are driving against your Time Machine, clattering against the hardened hull. You ask CAIN for information on Chill in 2985. 'Well, Falcon, the planet Chill is a ball of rock rich in minerals covered in a crust of ice. It is one of the coldest planets man has yet discovered. It is devoid of life and the atmosphere is ammonia based. However, at this time, only forty years ago from our time, there is a small mining station, mostly automated, run by a crew of five men. They are working a rich bed of titanium, used in many starship hulls. Incidentally Falcon, the Manager, Braxton Bragg, was a good friend of your grandfather's, your grandmother was Bragg's sister, so be careful. You will have to wear the battlesuit, your environment suit will not be enough to keep out the cold, Falcon. I will run up some stencils in the Molecular Convertor, you can paint on the insignia of the Federation Planetary Exploration Scouts. If you should run across the miners, you can pretend to a be a shipwrecked scout, crash-landed on Chill. Remember, Time Travel won't be discovered for another thirty years.' Thank you CAIN,' you reply. When you are ready you step out into the freezing atmosphere of Chill. Looking around, you can see a rugged landscape of twisted ice ridges and valleys. Setting the Rack detector, you soon discover the location of the last piece of the Rack. With the other three pieces of the Rack in your battlesuit utility containers, you set off towards it. The buffeting cross winds caused by the storm are too strong for you to use your jets, but you take great leaping strides, your battlesuit servos whining. Hailstones as large as your fist are battering against your armour and your instrument readout tells you that the suit is working overtime to ward off the deadly cold. Turn to 94.</p>
