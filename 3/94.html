<p>An hour passes as you labour on, and the storm lessens a little. Then you come to the top of a gnarled ice ridge, looking down into a valley, where a large grey dome rests. Black smoke seeping out from an exhaust vent is whipped away in the wind. This must be the mining station, and using the tripod again, you are able to tell that the item you seek lies far below it. Then you notice a figure in an industrial powersuit coming around the back of the Dome, making towards the circular air-lock door at its base. The figure sees you and stops in its tracks. The body is in a posture of surprise. Your battlesuit picks up a radio signal from the figure. 'I mean, wow, man, like really ultra! Who are you? I mean, I thought this filthy ice-cube was uninhabited,'and he breaks into laughter. You send a message back, saying you are a Scout whose Explorer Class starship's drive failed.</p>
<p>'Am I glad to see you!' you say. 'I thought I'd never find the mining station.'</p>
<p>'What a story, man. Hey, that's really ultra! You'd better come down, I'll take you to the manager. Ultra warm in the Dome.' You'll have to enter the Dome anyway so you go down and join the man. Minutes later, you are through the Dome's air-lock. The man is stripping off his powersuit, so you do the same, stepping out in your environment suit and hanging your battlesuit next to a row of the powersuits. They are virtually the same as yours save without weaponry, armour, microbeam radar, jetpack and the like. He is a tall, thin man, unshaven and unwashed, characterised by quick nervous movements of his hands. As he leads you down a functional grey corridor, all steel, lined with pipes and illuminated by strip-lights, he says, 'I am Sil McReady, the Engineer, pleased to meet you.' You introduce yourself as Lieutenant Falcon of the Scouts. 'Here's the Rec Room, not what you'd call really ultra but it's better'n stinking ice!' and he opens a door in the right hand wall. Turn to 359.</p>
