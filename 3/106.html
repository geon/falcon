<p>The next morning the captain tells you that you have arrived at the area you are looking for. Using the detector, you tell the captain the exact spot where you would like the 'diving bell' lowered. He shrugs his shoulders saying, 'Whatever you like, but I would have thought one place is as good as another on this God-forsaken expanse of dust!' Ignoring the murmured comments of 'Completely mad, these Offworlders', you get into Falcon's Wing and the crew hook it up with steel hausers to a huge drum that will lower the 'diving bell'. Sitting in your crashcouch, you watch through the cameras as you sink into the dust. Soon the screens are completely black, there is absolutely no light and sight is totally useless. Falcon's Wing begins to bob slightly as it goes down. CAIN chimes: 'I think you should know that some life forms can be dangerous here, Falcon. No real research has been done, but it is thought that the creatures of the Sea of Dust use some kind of sonar as their senses. Apparently they emit a light beam of sound which is bounced off objects and the sound reflection is interpreted, like you would interpret light coming into your eyes, Falcon.' With a jarring shudder you hit the bottom. Carefully donning your battlesuit and taking the detector tripod, you descend into the Sea of Dust. You cannot see anything except the battlesuit readout on your face plate. The pressure is great and is almost at the maximum your suit can take. You will have to be quick. Using the tripod you soon have the location of the Rack segment. You engage your microbeam radar and the Rack piece registers as a small blip on your face plate display, only a few yards to your left. Slowly you make your way towards it, the servos of your suit whining under the strain of moving through so much dust. Turn to 174.</p>
