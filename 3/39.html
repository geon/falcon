<p>Soon you are back in your bay at the Eiger Vault. You put a call through to Jobanque on the holophone, Priority One. He answers immediately: 'Falcon, what news?' You tell him what has happened and what the situation is on Dustbowl. 'Right, I'll authorise the battlesuit,' he says, 'and I'll talk to you soon.' With that he breaks contact. You wait while your polybdenum supply is replenished. Soon Jobanque holophones through. 'Okay, Falcon, Skirrow and I have come up with something. Falcon's Wing will be painted in company colours and made to look like a scientific research diving bell. You can pretend to be a scientist from Earth, sponsored by a fictitious Earth company, say the Eiger Coporation, sent to Dustbowl to research the breeding habits of the Dustwhale. We'll give you forged credentials and money, of course - in this case Dustbowl placs. The battlesuit has been modified for high pressure. You won't be able to see anything down there, but you'll have your microbeam radar, and we've fitted a high resolution graphic delineator. This will analyse the radar reading and render it as a visual graphic on your battlesuit face plate. It'll be just like seeing normally almost. Anything you see won't actually be there, the graphic delineator will just show you what something the radar has picked up looks like. You'll have to use the radar to determine the position of anything. We'll give you some high-tensile wire to lower Falcon's Wing and the like, to make your scientific expedition look convincing. You'll have to go back to Dustbowl and hire a whaling ship and get it to take you out to where the Rack section lies - this kind of expedition was reasonably common in those times. I know this is breaking the First Law of TIME, but under the circumstances, we have no choice. One final thing - Dustbowl in 2764 had a high level of legislation. They were particularly strict on citizens carrying fire arms, especially energy weapons, so be careful with your blaster. That's all. Good luck, Falcon!' Moments later, the battlesuit is delivered to you, along with a selection of equipment, steel lances, rotary drums, a mini-lab and the battlesuit. Maintenance technicians are working frantically on the hull of Falcon's Wing. Painting it in green and gold and adding bits of impressive, but useless, equipment to its hulk. An hour or so later, everything is ready and you fade into null-space, bound for Dustbowl once more. Turn to 48.</p>
