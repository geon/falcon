<p>You race on. It is growing warmer down this tunnel and the light ahead is growing brighter. Soon your suit coolant begins to circulate as the heat rises dramatically. Suddenly you burst out into a dim white light, which seems painfully bright after the gloomy green-tinged blackness of Darkhome. You have emerged into a large natural cavern, silent and undisturbed for centuries judging by the dust. Looking up you see the roof of the cavern, far above. It is cracked and open to the sky in places. Shafts of bright white light trickle down into the blackness below, where it loses its intensity. Particles of dust drift slowly in the light like planets in the vastness of space. Your suit registers high levels of harmful radiation and you move on towards another tunnel that leads out of the cavern. Turn to 290.</p>
