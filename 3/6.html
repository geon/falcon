<p>CAIN chimes: 'I have disguised your Time Machine as an adobe house; fortunately no organic life forms were nearby to witness its sudden appearance. We have arrived in Tenochtitlan, the great capital city of the Aztec Empire, Falcon. Its population has been estimated in hundreds of thousands which makes it one of the largest cities in the world at this time. The current 'Uei Tlatoan, or Emperor, is Ahuitzotl, a cruel and vicious tyrant. His son was Moctezuma II, who was Emperor when the Spaniards, along with smallpox, all but wiped out this civilisation and its people. The Aztecs practised a brutal religion, requiring mass human sacrifice, and, after, the consumption of the victim's flesh. Indeed, wars called 'Flowery Wars' were often fought between nations for no reason other than to garner prisoners for sacrifice. Ahuitzotl was responsible for the sacrifice of 20,000 defeated victims in one day, in this very year.' You ask CAIN to run off a suitable set of clothes for you in the Molecular Converter. Soon you are dressed in the clothing of what CAIN tells you is one of the two elite military orders in the Aztec Empire, the Eagle Knights. The other is the Jaguar Knights. You are wearing a fantastic headress of white eagle feathers, a quilted patterned jacket, and a brightly coloured skirt adorned with feathers, with copper anklets and bracelets. Your weapon is a wooden club inlaid with sharp flints of obsidian. You tuck your blaster under the jacket.</p>
