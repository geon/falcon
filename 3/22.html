<p>You set co-ordinates for South America, Earth, in 1487 AD and soon Falcon's Wing is sailing on the Winds of Time towards its destination. You may lie in your Autodoc during this journey and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance. The cameras show that you have materialised in bright sunshine. You hold your breath in astonishment as the cameras revolve. You are in a great city in the middle of a lake. The shores of the lake are studded with townships, each with a core of brightly painted stone houses, surrounded by smaller white adobe houses. Each township has a tiered, brilliantly painted pyramid rising from it. The city itself is perfectly square, with three causeways leading to the mainland. It seems to have been constructed with great precision. Much of the city is criss-crossed with canals, upon which are moored many canoes. The houses are mostly of adobe, with some of stone, presumably for the rich and powerful, and all are single storey buildings with no windows. You can see the flat roof tops have low tables on them, pottery and the like. But your attention is drawn to the centre of the city. You can see a huge pyramid reaching up over the city. Other large buildings surround it, covered in carved friezes, in a strange, stiff style. The pyramid has a wide flight of steps climbing up its front. You can see figures moving all over it but, strangely, the immediate vicinity seems deserted as do the townships. However, the external microphones are picking up the noise of a huge crowd coming from the main pyramid. Turn to 6.</p>
