<p>You play your blaster across the width of the corridor, cutting down the priests as one. Turning, you sprint on to the portal at the end of the corridor. Looking in you can see a stone altar at the far end of a large room. Upon it lies a translucent white triangle, giving off a faint white light, a part of the Rack. The floor in front of the altar is carved into a chequered grid of nine large stone slabs. Suddenly, there is a crunching sound above you. Looking up you can see the ceiling is being ripped open, and you can hear a snarling howl of ferocious fage - Baal is smashing his way in. You dash out onto the floor, knowing you must try to get the triangle before Baal breaks in. Make a Chance Roll.</p>
<p>If you score 1, 2, 3 or 4, turn to 266</p>
