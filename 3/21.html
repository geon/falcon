<p>You move round behind the cave and climb up the ridge. Soon you are standing above the cave when suddenly your battlesuit takes a bolt of laser fire. Subtract one from your armour points, but you are unhurt. You look up to the opposite ridge as you drop to the ice. Achov, or rather the creature, is on top of the ridge, a laser rifle in his hands. It set a trap for you and you fell for it. The face inside the powersuit is not Achov's, it is something else, something you are glad not to be able to make out. You are taken by surprise and it opens fire again, a lance of ruby light spanning the gap between the ridges in nano-second. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
