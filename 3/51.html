<p>The disciple of Baalmakes no move, obviously he doesn't know you have recognised him. Some hours later Falcon's Wing is stowed in the hold and the ship sets sail, scudding across the dust. The second day out, you are gazing out across the heaving red sea when you look behind you to see a ring of twenty or more sailors hemming you in, their faces staring mercilessly. The captain steps forward and says: 'You chose the wrong ship, Offworlder. We are all of the old religion, our Lord is he who you would wish to imprison, Baal, Lord of the Flies. He sent word to us of your coming and now we will exact retribution.' He signals to his men and soon you are overpowered. There is nothing you can do against so many. You are tied up to a block of wood and your heart is cut out and offered up to Baal as a sacrifice. You have failed.</p>
