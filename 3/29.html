<p>As you walk onward, in the soft glow of the phosphorescent fungus, the unmistakable sound of battle echoes down the tunnel. Cautiously edging along the side of the corridor you come to a T-junction. Poking your head out you look to the left. A group of yellow and black furred Burrowers are waiting placidly, a mass of mud and rock at their feet. Turning your head to the right, you are greeted by the cause of the sound. The tunnel is filled with two lines of what must be Warriors, some yellow and black, the others with dull red fur, engaged in a vicious death struggle. The Warriors are frightening to look at. They have two arms ending in what can only be described as serrated sword blades, presumably of bone or hardened cartilage. Viciously sharp horns protrude from their domed heads, their elbows and knees. Their feet resemble the claws of a bird, except that they are of sharp cartilage, all talons. Their heads are much the same as the Burrowers, except for the massive fangs. What is most frightening is their speed and ferocity and the feral savagery with which they are ripping each other into shreds. Incredibly swift and powerful, they are creatures bred for one thing only - killing. Behind each rank of Warriors there are two or three Nobles, giving orders. They are human in shape, except for their heads. These are much the same as the Burrowers, except for a membrane covering a circular cavity above the mouth. They communicate by vibrating this membrane to produce sound. Turn to 44.</p>
