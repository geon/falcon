<p>You continue down the shadowed corridor. After a few minutes it opens out into a large chamber, and to a grisly brutal sight. Large shattered eggs lie everywhere, seeping the glutinous remains of many Cavers, heartlessly killed before hatching. It looks as if an entire batch has been destroyed. It is indeed a bitter internal struggle you think to yourself as you hurry on to a tunnel on the other side of the chamber. This leads to another cavern, obviously a Caver's 'farm'. Several red-furred Workers, ignoring you completely, tend large stone vats filled with decaying organic matter. These Workers are two-armed with large hands. Your stomach turns as you notice the semi-decayed remains of many types of Cavers in the vats. A vast expanse of mushroom-like fungus stretches into the darkness. Workers carrying some of the rotting sludge in stone jars are spreading it over the fungus. The Cavers recycle their dead by feeding them to the fungus, presumably their staple diet. Thankful that you are wearing your environment suit and cannot smell anything, you continue along the tunnel that leads out of the cavern. Turn to 107.</p>
