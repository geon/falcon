<p>A tentacle whips out, slapping your hand to one side so that the bolt of plasma discharges into the wall with a crash like a clap of thunder. You utter a shriek of revulsion as another tentacle snakes wetly around your thigh. Your leg begins to burn agonisingly as you realise the slime that coats it is eating into your flesh. Lose 3 Endurance points and subtract 1 from your Evasion Modifier permanently as the wound will never heal properly. If you still live, you fire your blaster again as the ghastly apparition writhes before you. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
