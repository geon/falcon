				<p>158</p>
<p>A bolt of superheated plasma streaks towards the top of the pyramid, but your aim is off and it hits a priest, hurling him over the altar in a ball of flame. The crowd back away from you in terror, but Baal has spotted you. You feel his mind probing yours. Then an incredibly powerful will invades your mind, psychic power you never imagined possible and against which you have no hope of resisting. You can do nothing as he forces you to mount the pyramid. Your heart is cut out and you are consumed by Baal.</p>
