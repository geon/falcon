<p>You walk to the door of the Recreation building and it slides open. Stepping in you find yourself in a small airlock, presumably to minimise the amount of dust getting into the main building. You enter a large room with a bar at one end. The air is free of dust and you remove your filter mask. There are a few people, sailors mostly, eating and drinking in groups at various tables. They look up as you enter and you can hear one or two muttering 'Offworlders'. You walk to the bar intent on asking the barman's advice on finding a whaling ship, when your attention is drawn to a small man, obviously drunk, telling a story to a group of attentive listeners. 'Yup, I served on the Winged Demon on its last voyage and ...'</p>
<p>'What did you want to take up with the likes of them for?' interrupts one of the men at his table.</p>
<p>'I needed a few placs, right. Be quiet and listen up. They needed a few extra whalers for this trip, so me and a few others signed up We sailed out for a day or two but, get this, although several whales were sighted, we didn't do no whaling at all! Then one night, I was woke by a noise on deck. I went up and guess what I saw... ? Well, most of the regular crew was dressed in black robes and they were chanting some weird song. And then, strike me dead if I'm lying, a huge figure, more'n twenty foot tall, bursts up outta the sea. In the ship's lights 1 could see he was as red as dust and his eyes were yellow and unnatural looking.' Some of the men scoff at this, but the small man goes on: 'It's true, honest. He flies, yes flies, up above the ship and there was this awful smile on his face, dust etch my bones, I'll never forget that smile as long as I live, pure evil it was. Well, at this I get off that deck as quick as I can and into my bunk. And that's not the end of it. The next day I could swear there were less of them onboard as when we started out. Anyway, we did do some whaling on the way back, but I can tell you, I'm never working on the Winged Demon no more!'</p>
<p>There is silence around the table for a moment but one of the men says, 'You've been drinking too much as usual,' and they break into uproarious laughter. Turning away, you ask the barman about whaling ships for hire.</p>
<p>'Well, most any whaler is up for hire,' he replies, 'but you gotta be careful. I mean, I wouldn't hire out the Winged Demon, even if it was for nothing. Tell you what though, the Dustskate should be here in a day or two and Captain Cresap Ord's a good man. That's your best bet if you're not in a hurry.' Thanking him, you leave the Recreation Centre.
