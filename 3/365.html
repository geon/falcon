<p>Looking out, you can see Caleb and Achov running into the Rec Room and you follow them in. There is an air of excitement, as Achov speaks rapidly. 'Brax, the Autodrill has uncovered a large cavern, deep in the rock. I've never seen anything like it. We went down and had a look, we found these.' And he puts two objects onto the table. One is a strange leathery egg, about the size of a football. The other sends a rush of adrenalin through your blood - it is the final piece of the Rack. 'Not only that, there is a circular shaft leading from the cavern roof right up through a mile of rock, up to the ice. Can't be natural. Looks like it's some remains of the Ancient's culture, the Federation'll pay through the nose to examine it. We're as good as rich.'</p>
<p>Braxton Bragg looks at them thoughtfully. 'You could be right Achov, this egg could be a real find; bit weird though, isn't it?'</p>
<p>'Yeah, really ultra, man,' McReady chips in to be answered by several irritated glares.</p>
<p>'We'll get Tsu Tsang to examine it.' Braxton Bragg continues. 'Here, Achov, take it to her, and then get back to work, the Mining Company doesn't pay you to sit around!' He laughs. When they have gone, Braxton eyes you speculatively, Tunny a Fed Scout should turn up at the same time as we find this, eh?'</p>
<p>'Yes, an amazing coincidence, isn't it,' you reply and he smiles. You decide to return to your cabin and wait for night to fall and the crew to sleep. Then you can creep into the lab, take the Rack and leave, they'll think it's all some secret government operation. At any rate, it seems Baal is not here in person, as on Cave and Tenochtitlan. Turn to 413.</p>
