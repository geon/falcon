<p>You disappear unseen, down the tunnel leading away from the scene of bloody carnage. After a while, the tunnel forks. The right hand tunnel is dark and gloomy, as featureless as the rest of Darkhome. However, you can see a faint glimmer of white light down the left tunnel. Which tunnel will you go down:</p>

			<table class="choices">
				
							<tr>
								<td>The left hand tunnel?</td>
								<td><a href="362.html">Turn to 362</a></td>
							</tr>

							<tr>
								<td>The right hand tunnel?</td>
								<td><a href="374.html">Turn to 374</a></td>
							</tr>
