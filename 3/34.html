<p>You set the co-ordinates for North America, Earth 1863 AD, and instruct CAIN to engage the Variac Drive. Moments later your mind is searching through null-space for the psychic pattern that marks the North American timehole. You may lie in your Autodoc and restore up to 12 points of lost Endurance during the journey. You rematerialise on a wooded hill, with good all-round visibility, but your vision is partially obscured by clouds of gunsmoke. To the south is a small town wreathed in smoke. Dense forest lies to the east, another wooded hill rising from it. To the west, you can see a column of men, armed with primitive muskets and dressed virtually in rags, mostly a butternut brown in colour. A few, mainly officers, are wearing grey uniforms. They are marching towards you across a road. The air is filled with the sound of volleys of musket-fire, the boom of cannon and the sound of many men at war. Suddenly a column of men dressed in blue uniforms, stream past your hill, near the town, in what can only be described as an orderly rout. It appears you have arrived in the middle of a battle. You ask CAIN for information. This is the field of Gettysburg, a decisive battle in the American Civil War fought on the eastern edge of North America, Falcon. It was fought over three days, and we have arrived in the late afternoon of the first day. The Civil War was between the Union and the Confederacy, over reasons too detailed to go into here, unless you'd like me to?'</p>
<p>'No, no, CAIN, that's all right,' you interrupt hastily.</p>
<p>'Well, the Confederacy, the men in grey, had the better of the first day, but ultimately they were defeated, despite their brilliant commander. General Robert E. Lee. You have materialised on Benner's Hill. The hill to the south is Culp's Hill and beyond that Cemetery Ridge. The town is, of course, Gettysburg. It would be best to disguise you as a Confederate soldier for the moment. However, the jacket will be reversible, so that the outside is grey, the inside blue, if you should need to change sides in a hurry.' Donning the disguise the Molecular Converter has given you (your helmet is now a peaked grey cap), you take the detector tripod and leave Falcon's Wing. Turn to 314.</p>
