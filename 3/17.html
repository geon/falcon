<p>You disappear into the hologram as the bolt of energy explodes behind you, leaving a deep crater in the road. You are drawn up into Falcon's Wing and jump into your crash-couch, setting coordinates for the Eiger Vault as quickly as you can. The cameras show Baal hesitating at your disappearance, but the screens are filled with yellow flame as he blasts Falcon's Wing. The Time Machine shudders as Baal slams into it, howling malevolently, and it crashes onto its side. Your console displays a stream of damage reports, lights flashing and alarms screaming. You shout at CAIN to engage the Variac Drive, hoping it is not damaged, as, to your horror, Baal picks up Falcon's Wing as if it were made of wood and prepares to dash it to the ground. Make a Chance Roll.</p>
<p>If you score 1, 2, 3 or 4, turn to 50</p>
