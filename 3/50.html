<p>Falcon's Wing is hurled through the air but winks out inches from the ground. Safe in the grey nothingness of null-space, you heave a sigh of relief, calming your shattered nerves. Soon you are floating on the Winds of Time headed for the Eiger Vault. You ask CAIN what has happened in the timelines, knowing that the first law of TIME has been broken on Tenochtitlan to an unprecedented degree. It replies that the society was almost completely wiped out by the Spaniards in a few more decades, thus cancelling any serious time damage. You may lie in your Autodoc and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance on this journey. Have you been given any information about the Planet Cave? If you have, turn to 86. If you have not, turn to 76.</p>
