<p>You concentrate hard, trying to bend the huge warrior to your will. Luckily, his thought patterns are not unlike a human's, and you catch him completely unawares; to him you are a young Rigellian medic, posing little threat. He falls under your domination. You force him to run away from the glade for as long as you can hold him under your power. He is some miles away when you release him. Soon you are in the crash-couch of Falcon's Wing. Your body feels as light as air now that you are in the artificial gravity of Falcon's Wing. After you have told CAIN what happened, it chimes: 'You must have landed in a Rigellian ritual combat arena. My data banks tell me you have changed Rigellian history slightly, Falcon. The defeated Warrior was of the Arocks clan. They have now been disgraced since you were taken to be an Arocks assassin with a new "dishonourable" weapon. This will have to be logged in TIME records of course.' Resisting the temptation to turn CAIN off, you prepare for another time jump. Where will you search for the Rack now:</p>
