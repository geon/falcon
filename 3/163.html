<p>Before Baal can throw the body at you, a horde of yellow and blacked striped Warriors boil into the cavern, between you and Baal. The loyalists have broken through! The Nobles order them to attack Baal immediately, his size and bearing draw their attention away from you and you pass unnoticed. You wait until the exit tunnel is cleared of the loyalist army and dart down it. Baal is surrounded by hundreds of Warriors, for the Cavers have no way of actually hurting Baal, you should be in Falcon's Wing by the time he is free to follow. Turn to 237.</p>
