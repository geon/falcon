<p>The white-hot lightning takes Baal full in the chest and he staggers back as you keep up a steady stream of plasma, whilst you charge for the exit. Baal howls in pain, but then your blaster stops firing, its safety mechanism cutting in as it heats up dangerously. If you have the severed hand-blade of a Caver Warrior, turn to 163, if not read on. Baal, essentially unhurt, hurls the body of the Warrior at you with punishing force. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
