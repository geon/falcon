<p>You manage to control the Nobles. Instantly you force them to order the Warriors to stop their charge. Then they turn and fire their laser-pistols at the Baal-Mother, who is shouting in rage. It writhes in pain as you force the Nobles to keep up their lancing fire. Then the blubbery mass of the Mother begins to dissolve before your very eyes, seemingly metamorphosing. Seconds later, Baal stands in the Mother's place, bellowing in anger. With a flash of insight, you realise he has been posing as a Cave Mother using his hallucinatory mind-powers, but the needlelike pulses of the Noble's lasers, whilst not harming him seriously, have shaken him, preventing him from maintaining the illusion. Taking this opportunity, you release the Nobles and sprint for the door. The Nobles stare at Baal and begin trilling agitatedly amongst themselves. They know they have been tricked into rebelling against their rightful Mother and they see Baal as an intruder now. However, Baal, furious, screams, 'You have meddled in my plans too often, mortal. Your puny little organisation can never hope to defeat me, Baal, the Lord of Flies!' and the sound echoes around the chamber so that you can almost feel the floor reverberating. Then he points at you, and a yellow bolt of energy forks from his finger, crackling through the air towards you. You must try to dodge the attack. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
