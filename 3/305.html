<p>You can feel that parts of the Rack are growing hot. Examining them, you can see they are pulsing with white light, reacting to the presence of Baal. Then you can feel an incredibly powerful malevolent will, the mind of Baal, invading your mind. You cannot stand against such force you realise. Baal smiles evilly. But then the Rack segments begin to pulse faster and the power of Baal's will lessens. His smile fades and he struggles to seize your mind. His attack continues to fade, until you see him struggling to use his mind powers, his face contorted with rage. He bellows, 'So, you have half of the Rack! But now I will end your petty existence, mortal.' His voice reverberates around the room, almost deafening you. You realise that the two parts of the Rack, acting together, are preventing him from using his psychic power! He screams in rage, then he points at you and a crackling ball of yellow energy explodes from his hand and burns towards you. Thunderstruck by such natural power, you hurl yourself out of the door in an attempt to avoid the fireball. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
