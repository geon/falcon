<p>The Rigellian tries to twist aside but a white-hot stream of plasma takes him in the shoulder and he is bowled to the ground. He lies there inert, but still breathing. Soon you are in the crashcouch of Falcon's Wing. Your body feels as light as air now that you are in the artificial gravity of Falcon's Wing. After you have told CAIN what happened, it chimes: 'You must have landed in a Rigellian ritual combat arena. My data banks tell me you have changed Rigellian history slightly, Falcon. The defeated warrior was of the Arocks clan. They have now been disgraced since you were taken to be an Arocks assassin with a new 'dishonourable' weapon. This will have to be logged in TIME records of course.' Resisting the temptation to turn CAIN off, you prepare for another time jump. Where will you search for the Rack now:</p>
