<p>You squeeze the trigger and a stream of plasma shoots towards Baal, but suddenly your blaster cuts out. To your horror you realise it has been depleted when you used it to burn a hole through the rock. You will have to do without it until you are in Falcon's Wing when you can fit another energy pack to your blaster. The plasma splashes off Baal's chest but he barely notices it, he hardly even pauses as he hurls the corpse of the Warrior at you with punishing force. Caught off guard the body slams into you, sending you crashing to the ground. Luckily none of its sharp protuberances have cut you, but the impact has cracked one of your ribs. Lose 4 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you rise to your feet. If you have the severed hand-blade of a Caver Warrior in your possession, turn to 163, if not read on. Baal grabs another body as if it were a rag doll. You dash for the exit as he hurls it at you. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
