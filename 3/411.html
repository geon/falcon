<p>Concentrating hard, you project the force of your will into the mind of the fly being. Its mind is a confusing swirl of alien thought patterns, so different that it almost unhinges your mind. However, it seems the creature is under some other kind of control, nothing like the mental domination you are familiar with, rather some kind of binding that has been upon the fly being for centuries beyond reckoning, something which you are unable to affect. Then its mind invades yours, as its physical body settles upon you. The combination of the sight of the enormous insectoid head, a greenish proboscis, dripping saliva and digestive juices, reeking of decay, descending towards you and the mental union with a creature whose mind is unutterably alien, sends you stark raving mad and you are unable to feel as it slowly sucks your body dry.</p>
