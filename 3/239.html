<p>You draw your blaster and burn the tentacles in two, but the section around your ankle continues to tighten, melting together. You stagger back, as unendurable agony rips through your body. It begins to absorb your foot, fusing with it and becoming a pulpy mass at the bottom of your leg. Suddenly two more tentacles burst out of it and wrap themselves around your thigh. Then they tear themselves away from the mass of your foot, forming jointed spider-like legs, ending in two barbed stings. The stings whip up and bury themselves into your chest, mercifully killing you instantly.</p>
