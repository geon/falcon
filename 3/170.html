<p>A bolt of superheated plasma streaks towards Baal, hitting him squarely in the chest. Coruscating streams of plasma crackle and spit across his body and he staggers back in the air, howling like thunder. The crowd back off away from you, and you can hear a muttering of 'Quetzacoatl'. From what you know of Aztec mythology, they think you are a god, Quetzacoatl, the enemy of Huitzilopochtli. This is too much for them and they begin to flee from the plaza in droves, except for the black-robed priests and some of the knights, although they make no attempts to prevent the massed prisoners from running. Then, to your horror, you see that Baal has survived the blast of plasma and is now enraged, snarling in fury. He points at you and, to your shocked amazement, a ball of yellow crackling energy erupts from his arm and speeds toward you, leaving a glowing vapour trail in the sky. Desperately, you try to leap aside, amazed at such a display of inherent power. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
