<p>The air begins to shimmer above the altar, at the top of the pyramid. A huge twenty-foot figure materialises, hanging in ' space. It is a powerfully muscled man, a deep red in colour, with slitted, reptillian eyes and taloned fingers. A nimbus of yellow energy plays about its form. You recognise Baal. The crowd seems to gasp in astonishment as one, and many fall to their knees, trembling in fear. The priests and the Emperor fall abjectly to the floor and a whisper of 'Huitzilopochtli! It's Huitzilopochtli, the Lord of War,' ripples around the plaza. Turn to 82.</p>
