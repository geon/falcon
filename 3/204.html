<p>You race on through the tunnels of Darkhome, retracing your steps. It is completely deserted, save for the bodies of many Warriors, mostly red-furred, and the oblivious workers still toiling away. You are just leaving the area where you saw the brutal battle between the loyalists and the rebels when you can hear a rushing of wind and the voice of Baal echoing through the tunnels behind you: 'I am coming for you, you little animal, and I shall tear you limb from limb and devour your soul!' Desperately you push yourself on, until you burst into the Cavern housing Falcon's Wing. The Burrowers are still digging. You are almost in your Time Machine when Baal flies into the cave, his bulk filling the tunnel completely, indeed if he could not have flown headfirst, he would not have been able to traverse the corridors of Darkhome at all. He holds a long steel girder in one hand which he hurls at you like a spear, at the instant he spots you. You try to dodge the attack, wishing fervently you had some means with which to combat the super-powerful being. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
