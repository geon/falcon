<p>You set co-ordinates for Earth in 3033 AD and you are soon surrounded by the grey nothingness of null-space. You may lie in your Autodoc and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance during the journey. You rematerialise in the Eiger Vault and whilst a TIME maintenance team is replenishing Falcon's Wing's supply of polybdenum, you instruct CAIN to link up with the Eiger Service computer to check for any news. CAIN chimes: 'Incoming holomessage Falcon.'</p>
<p>Agent Bloodhound's face seems to come alive inside Falcon's Wing. He nods a greeting at you. 'On line, Falcon. How's the mission going? A tough one this, eh? Anyway, I have an important mesage for you. We've picked up some strange disturbances in the timelines of the timehole on Dustbowl. I've just returned from a routine check there. Something appeared and then left the Dustbowl timehole within a space of about one hour. It caused a disturbance in the Winds of Time that is completely unlike anything previously recorded and was of great power. Monitoring is sure it was not a Variac Drive emission. It could be Baal. That's all for now, Falcon. Good luck, I hope to see you soon in the Rec Centre.'</p>
<p>'Thanks Blood,' you reply. You must continue your search. Where will you go to next:</p>
