<p>There is a loud woosh and a six foot barbed harpoon whirs over your head and crashes into the wall of the poopdeck, just above the captain's door. In an instant you are up and running down the gangplank, soon to be lost amongst the crates and equipment piled up everywhere on the harbourside. You return to Falcon's Wing where you decide to wait until the Winged Demon has left on another whaling expedition, so you can find another ship. You instruct CAIN to disguise Falcon's Wing as a pile of whaling equipment to avoid the prying eyes of anyone in search of the scientist's diving bell. You may lie in your Autodoc if you wish, and gain up to 6 points of lost Endurance. Turn to 342.</p>
