<p>You step out into the Control Room. Suddenly, something sweeps across your legs, knocking you to the ground. Looking around, you see a set of several long human-like arms, charred and burnt, heaving a bloated body out from under the lift. It had been clinging to the bottom of the lift. A crocodile head, jaws snapping, rears up above you, dripping slimy juices. You try to roll aside as the head whips down at you. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
