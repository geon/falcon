<p>You split up at the junction wishing each other good luck. You move on down the centremost tunnel cautiously, your flamethrower at the ready. You come to the Mining Control Centre, scanning it carefully. It is deserted. You cross it to the lift to the mines. You pass your hand over a small beam of light, and the lift door slides open. You step back, but it is empty. You walk in and the door closes noiselessly behind you. Disregarding Bragg's warning in your quest for the final segment of the Rack, you select the lowest level and the lift begins to drop with gut wrenching speed, and after a few minutes it comes to a stop. Turn to 151.</p>
