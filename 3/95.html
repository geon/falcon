<p>In a flash you have your blaster in your hand. Squeezing the trigger you bathe your assailant in a stream of hot plasma. His dagger stops inches from your side and he is blown back against the wall with a loud crash, sinking to the floor, a charred mess. The other two, screaming loudly, hurl themselves at you. You blast one, burning his leg and are struggling with the other when Cresap Ord bursts in with several men. Your attackers are pulled off. After questioning you, the captain orders them locked in the brig. He asks why you think they attacked you, but you pretend ignorance. He examines you suspiciously for a few seconds and then says, 'Anyway, carrying an energy weapon is illegal. Normally, I'm supposed to arrest you now and return to port, but I need the placs you'll pay me. However, I'll have to take the weapon and hand you over to the authorities when we return. It shouldn't be too bad, you are an Offworlder and you were acting in self-defence.' He holds out his hand and you give him your blaster, realising it would be more trouble than it's worth to refuse it. You have several more in Falcon's Wing anyway. You may note you have a new blaster the next time you are in Falcon's Wing. The captain thanks you and leaves, telling you to lock the door. The rest of the night passes uneventfully. Turn to 106.</p>
