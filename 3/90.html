<p>The lift functions as an Environment Dome, but is completely transparent. You can see out over the Sea of Dust. The sun, bright and very white, is rising over the edge of the cliffs, many miles distant, illuminating the Sea of Dust with silver light. Visibility is not good, the air is filled with fine dust which glitters redly in the sun, but you can still make out the vast expanse of heaving dust, a deep rusty red, almost like a lake of blood, punctuated with small specks of gleaming silver - whaling ships. The lift, actually as large as the warehouse you arrived in, hurtles down at an incredible pace and soon you are on the wharf of the port, breathing through your mask. Several massive whaling ships, of steel from bow to stern, and powered with sails, are berthed. Some are unloading massive crates of whalemeat and oil, others are taking in supplies before going out again. Darting behind a large crate you set up the tripod and begin searching for any signs of the Rack. You find nothing, and, after cursing your wasted journey, head back to the lift. Turn to 40.</p>
