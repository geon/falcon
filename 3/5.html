<p>You set co-ordinates for Earth in 3033 AD and you are soon surrounded by the grey nothingness of null-space. You may lie in your Autodoc and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance points during the journey. You rematerialise in the Eiger Vault and whilst a TIME maintenance team replenishes Falcon Wing's supply of polybdenum, you instruct CAIN to link up with the Eiger Service computer to check for any news. CAIN reports that nothing new has occurred during your visit to Gettysburg. You will have to continue your search unaided. Which timehole will you travel to:</p>
