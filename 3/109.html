<p>You decide to Thinkstrike the stocky Rigellian as he is nearest to the clump of trees that disguise Falcon's Wing. You hurl a blast of mental energy at him. There is a grunt of pain and he throws his head back and staggers like a wounded elephant. The other Rigellian does not hesitate; he twists aside and, his arm a blur, seems to pass the twin-bladed sword across the stocky Rigellian's thigh, opening up a deep wound. He follows up with a mighty axe blow, and the stocky Rigellian is hurled backwards. Suddenly he disappears into a tree. To your horror you realise he has fallen into the hologram disguising Falcon's Wing! The taller Rigellian stands stock still in utter amazement. You must act quickly. Your Time Machine could be damaged and you must also minimise any effects on Rigellian history its sighting may have. Will you:</p>
