<p>You swim powerfully for what you hope is the surface. Then your head breaks through the dust, into the air. Clinging to a nearby iron stanchion that supports the quayside you clear the dust from your face. Hiding behind the iron pillars, you make your way down the side of the quay, struggling through the dust, your filter mask working overtime. When you are out of sight of the Winged Demon, you climb up one of the stanchions to the harbourside and make your way to Falcon's Wing where you decide to wait until the Winged Demon has left on another whaling expedition, so you can find another ship. You instruct CAIN to disguise Falcon's Wing as a pile of whaling equipment to avoid the prying eyes of anyone in search of the scientist's diving bell. You may lie in you Autodoc if you wish, and gain up to 6 points of lost Endurance. Turn to 342.</p>
