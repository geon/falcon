<p>You walk up the gang plank and onto the main deck of the 'Winged Demon'. A sailor is polishing a huge gun on a swivel mount. It is a rocket powered harpoon gun. His filter mask is painted to resemble an insect's head, and he stares at you dully. You ask for the captain. He stands motionless for a moment and then points down some stairs to a cabin door at the stern of the ship. You go down the steps and knock on the door. 'Enter,'says a gruff voice, and you open the door. It leads into a small cabin lined with charts of the Sea of Dust, with a bunk and a desk. Behind it sits a bearded man in black robes, wearing a yellow headband, presumably denoting his rank, and still wearing a black filter mask. Next to him stands a grizzled old sailor in traditional heavy whaling clothes, also bearded, a long whaler's knife at his side. 'Yes?' says the man behind the desk, eyeing you up and down quizzically. You introduce yourself as Professor Falcon, a scientist sent here by the Eiger Corporation on Earth. You ask if you can hire him and his ship and tell him of your planned expedition. He nods, interested, but when you tell him the co-ordinates you wish to go to he starts and stares at you. Then he says abruptly, 'What do you want to go there for?' his voice muffled by his mask. You tell him about your research into whales and that the area is a prime whale breeding ground. He looks at you and then says, 'Ah, I see,' and nods. 'It'll cost you ten thousand placs, all in. I'm Captain Nathan. Welcome aboard.' There is a knock on the door and a sailor enters. Have you been to Dustbowl once before on this mission?</p>
