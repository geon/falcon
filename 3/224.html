<p>His mind falls under your control. You order him to open the door and you step inside. In his hand he holds a thin pen black pencil device. You recognise it as a microbeam key, used to open doors with locks sensitive to a particular microbeam frequency. You take it from him. Note it on your Agent Profile. You are in a small alcove, with a dimly lit corridor leading away from it. You can hear the sounds of rhythmic chanting coming from down the corridor. Forcing the door guard to lead you down the corridor you decide to investigate the chanting. Then, pausing in the shadows at the end of the corridor, you are greeted by a strange sight. Forty to fifty people, all in black robes, are kneeling before some kind of altar upon which is manacled a young man. Beside him stands a tall hawk-faced figure, also in black robes. His hands are raised in supplication skyward, the sleeves of his robe falling to reveal a tattoo on his forearm in the shape of an insect much like the fly of Earth. He holds an obsidian dagger in his hand; it seems some strange religious ceremony is taking place. Then the robed man at the altar, presumably the high priest, screams, 'Come to us, O Servant of Baal,' and with one savage motion plunges the obsidian dagger into the man on the altar and carves out his heart. Then, much . to your surprise, something begins to materialise in the air above the altar. Soon it has resolved itself into what can only be described as a twelve-foot fly, its huge compound eyes glittering malevolently, its black limbs glistening with mucus and lined with cilia. Its mouthparts are working violently, oozing a vile greyish saliva. Everything goes quiet as the fly nestles onto the altar and begins to feed on the sacrificial victim. It extends a long proboscis, inserts it into the body of the victim and, with a disgusting slurping sound, begins to suck up the organic juices. It seems Baal has been here at some point, converting a group of the superstitious dustbowlers to his cause. Turn to 258.</p>
