<p>You must try to get through the door. You are edging around the edge of the cavern when your Psychic Awareness tells you that someone with mental powers has detected your mind. The Mother bellows loudly and the Nobles spin round, ordering twenty Warriors to kill you. The Warriors start moving towards you. Then a powerful mind attacks yours. You recognise the mental power of Baal. Suddenly the pieces of the Rack you are holding begin to grow hot and pulse brightly with white light and Baal's mind is driven back. Then the blubbery mass of the Mother begins to dissolve before your very eyes, seemingly metamorphosing. Seconds later, Baal stands in the Mother's place, bellowing in anger. With a flash of insight, you realise he has been posing as a Cave Mother using his hallucinatory mindpowers, but the two pieces of the Rack, acting together, prevent Baal from using his mental ability. At this, the Nobles order the Warriors to halt and begin trilling agitatedly amongst themselves. They know they have been tricked into rebelling against their rightful Mother and they see Baal as an intruder now. Taking this opportunity, you sprint for the door. However, Baal, furious, screams: 'You have meddled in my plans too often, mortal. Your puny little organisation can never hope to defeat me, Baal, the Lord of Flies!' and the sound echoes around the chamber so that you can almost feel the floor reverberating. Then he points at you, and a yellow bolt of energy forks from his finger, crackling through the air toward you. You must try to dodge the attack. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
