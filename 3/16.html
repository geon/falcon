<p>Looking at the camera screen you can see that you are on the wharf of some kind of port. Crates and miscellaneous equipment are piled everywhere and the air is almost opaque. It seems to be filled with clouds of very fine dust. The 'sea', you notice with surprise, is in fact a vast expanse of a heaving reddish substance, apparently also of very fine dust. The sun is high in the sky, and is very white. The sky is a misty maroon, tinged with blue at its edges. Behind you and stretching away to either side, fading into the distance, vast rocky cliffs tower high up into the sky, further than you can see. Some way to the left you can make out a cluster of buildings. CAIN tells you that Falcon's Wing is disguised as a set of crates marked 'Eiger Corporation' and proceeds to give you an historical up-date: 'Dustbowl is a completely barren planet, devoid of life except for one spot in the planet's surface, an enormous crater, presumably caused by a huge asteroid. The crater, some 2000 miles in diameter, is able to retain an atmosphere and is filled with extremely fine dust, forming the Sea of Dust. Within the sea, various organic life forms are found. Initially Dustbowl was, not unnaturally, passed over for colonisation. However, in 2631 AD, there was a short internecine struggle within the colony of Ascension. A group of religious fanatics had attempted to overthrow the government. This group was exiled from Ascension, along with many others Ascension saw as un- desirable. The exiles came to Dustbowl, the only place they could find, and have been here ever since. The original religion has all but died out by this time, apparently it involved some form of sacrifice. Dustbowl is now a thriving colony. Luckily the exiles found a native organism, the Dustwhale, a great source of income. Not only is its flesh consumed as a great delicacy on other worlds (especially Kelados), it was found that its oil was of vital importance in the manufacture of Anagathics, the life prolonging drugs so common in the Federation of 3033 AD, Falcon. The colony itself is noted for its repressive social laws and is thought by many to be "boring". The only city on Dustbowl, called Refuge, is high up on the cliffs that surround the crater and is covered in an Environment Dome. People leave the Dome only to sail the Sea of Dust and hunt the whales.'You will have to go outside to set up and use the detector so you ask CAIN to activate the Molecular Convertor. CAIN instructs the Convertor to manufacture the clothes of a typical Dustbowl sailor, a dustwhaler. You step out clothed in thick, bulky, brown and white cloth, designed to keep out as much dust as possible. You also have a filter mask, enabling you to breathe in the dustfilled atmosphere here. Soon you have the tripod in place. The strange luminescent gem begins to glow and you use your Psychic Awareness to explore its psionic emanations. You sense that it is registering the presence of a piece of the Rack! Your excitement fades though as you realise that it is lying out at sea, deep in the depths of the crater, buried under tons and tons of dust. It will prove difficult to get hold of. You decide to consult CAIN, and re-enter Falcon's Wing. Turn to 27.</p>
