<p>As you sit in your crash-couch, your Psychic Awareness begins to register some kind of psionic phenomena within Falcon's Wing. Turning around you can see that the three pieces of the Rack are glowing brightly, radiating a white light that you cannot look directly into. They begin to pulse faster and faster, emanating waves of psychic energy. Examining these, you are overjoyed to discover that they are transmitting the location of the fourth piece of the Rack. You are forced to break contact hurriedly, however. Being mentally linked to the incomplete Rack is very uncomfortable, its psychic power is rooted in some kind of machinery imbued with an unnatural half-life. The whole feel of the thing is horribly alien. You pause as a wave of nausea passes over you. Then, excitedly, you set co-ordinates for the timehole on planet Chill, in 2985 AD, where the fourth part of the Rack lies. You may lie in your Autodoc during the trip and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance. Turn to 353.</p>
