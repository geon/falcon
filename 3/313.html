<p>You turn and set a mental fix on the leading pursuer. You unleash a blast of mental energy and your target goes down like a sack of potatoes. Concentrating hard you repeat the process several times. Your pursuers come to a halt, almost as one. Some lie unconscious, others are holding their heads. Passerbys stare in horror and then hurry on. You can hear your pursuers muttering amongst themselves about 'sorcery' and 'magic'. They are a superstitious group and they seem disinclined to chase you after your display of power. Indeed some of them, unsure as to whether their prone comrades are still alive, are beginning to scuttle away. Seizing your chance, you run onwards and they are soon lost to sight. Moments later you are back in the warehouse containing Falcon's Wing, running to the crates marked 'Eiger Corporation'. Have you seen a man with a tattoo on his forearm here on Dustbowl?</p>
