<p>As you get to your feet, you can see that the Darkhome Noble rebels have made a decision, and a stream of Warriors are charging towards Baal. He towers above them, three times their height, destroying them in droves with blasts of yellow energy and great blows of his boulder-like fists. But the Warriors have no fear of death and they attack heedlessly. They seem to be unable to hurt him seriously, but you have time to act whilst he is distracted. You come to the steel door, but there does not seem to be any way of opening it. Will you;</p>

								<td>Put some magnesite (if you have arty) at the base of the door and blast it? Maybe the intense heat generated for a few seconds will burn a hole through the door?</td>
