<p>A bolt of superheated plasma burns off the head of your first target. Before the other two have noticed, you have cut another down. The remaining Noble turns and fires at you, but you dodge aside and a thin lance of blue light takes a chunk of rock out of the wall. Firing on the move, you catch the last Noble full in the chest, hurling it backwards in a ball of flaming fur. The rebels will soon be overwhelmed, especially as their Warrior reserve will be unable to act without orders from the Nobles. You head towards the tunnel when your foot nudges something on the floor. It is a Warrior's severed hand, more like a short sword than anything else. Picking it up, you put it in one of your suit pouches. Turn to 128.</p>
