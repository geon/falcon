<p>As fast as you can you lay a rocket at your feet and back off. When the large blip on your radar display is over the tiny blip of your rocket, you send out the detonation signal. There is no effect, and the creature keeps coming. Either it was completely unhurt, or, more likely, the weight of the dust contained the explosion. Perhaps it did not even go off. It is almost upon you now, turn to 197.</p>
