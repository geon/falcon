<p>You reach out with your mind and try to dominate the will of the Cosmic being known as Baal. But all you do is provoke Baal to contemptuous laughter as he sweeps aside your mental attack with ease. His ego is too powerful. However, your attention is drawn to the oncoming Warriors. All you can do is try to gain some time by using your blaster on them, as they are almost upon you. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
