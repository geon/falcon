<p>You can feel the rush of beaten air from the wings of the flybeast as its mandibles clash together inches from you. It pulls up to avoid what it thinks are crates, but what is in fact the hologram disguise. You roll onward and disappear into them and are drawn up into Falcon's Wing. The creature seems to guess what has happened for a second or two later, it crashes into Falcon's Wing, causing it to shudder ominously. However, CAIN assures you that Falcon's Wing is easily able to withstand the batterings of a mere twelve-foot fly. Muttering darkly about personality programmed computers, you settle into your crashcouch. Turn to 23.</p>
