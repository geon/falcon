<p>'Okay Lynx, I'll help. What do you think he's up to?'</p>
<p>Thanks Falcon, I can certainly use it! Well, at the moment, Yelov just seems to be trying to avoid being caught, but there is one thing he could do here today. The Union forces are pretty demoralised at the moment. In about an hour General Lee will order General Ewell, the commander of the Confederate forces on this flank, to launch an attack, if possible. Culp's Hill is unoccupied at the moment, it will be held by Union troops later, but if Ewell was to take it now... Historically, Ewell decided not to attack, but if he had, it is almost certain the rest of the Union army would have been routed, and the Confederacy would have won Gettysburg. My guess is that Yelov will try to force Ewell to order an attack using mind control. Imagine if the Confederacy had won the Civil War, Falcon? There would be two nations in America, history would be changed radically and we might never exist! This would be revenge enough for Yelov. Let's head for Ewell's HQ and await developments.' Will you:</p>
