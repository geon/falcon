<p>Soon you are sitting in the warmth and safety of Falcon's Wing, glad to be alive after your hair-raising experience. CAIN says: 'I have new information in my databanks, Falcon. It seems the mining station on Chill was the subject of some horrible attack by a particularly unpleasant alien life form. Only Braxton Bragg, the manager, survived. There is a story about a scout, Lieutenant Falcon, who later the scout service denied all knowledge of. Apparently he saved Bragg's life at the end, but was killed himself, although they never found his body.' You explain the recent events to CAIN, and it remarks, 'Baal must have visited this place many millenia ago, and planted the Rack section and the egg to guard it.' As you listen to CAIN, your attention is drawn to a bright white light behind you. Turning your head, you gasp in astonishment. The four triangles have linked together to form a four-pointed star and it is pulsing rapidly with light that is travelling round and round it. Suddenly, Falcon's Wing begins to dematerialise as your Variac Drive begins to function.</p>
<p>'CAIN?' you query.</p>
<p>'I am not activating it, Falcon.' Somehow the Rack of Baal is causing your Machine to travel in time. Your mind is soon tuned to the psychic emanations of the Rack and you are able to determine that you are headed for the timehole in the Dirkheim Void. But there is nothing in the Void, you think to yourself. After a while Falcon's Wing materialises in open space. Your mind reels as you look around, for there is nothing except blackness. Then the cameras reveal a large asteroid hanging in the black nothingness of the Void. A steel door, surrounded by dull glowing lights like the door in the cavern on Cave, is set into the side of the asteroid. 'I would say that the Rack has led us to Baal's base. Falcon. You have to take it in there.'Nodding grimly you don your battlesuit and, taking the Rack in an assistor arm, leave Falcon's Wing and jet towards the doorway. If you have a microbeam pencil key, turn to 410. If not, turn to 296.</p>
