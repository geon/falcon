				<p>279</p>
<p>You turn your suit volume up to maximum and send out a barrage of radio noise, hoping to 'jam' the creature's sonar. To your relief it works and you can see the blip on your radar going round in circles until it veers off in another direction. Still maintaining your radio barrage, you get back to Falcon's Wing. Quickly you fire your Particle Disruptor, severing the hausers connected to Falcon's Wing and then get inside it. As far as Captain Cresap Ord is concerned, when he draws up the severed hauser, it will seem that you died in an unfortunate accident. Turn to 260.</p>
