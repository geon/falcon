<p>The stream of superheated plasma takes Baal full in the chest. At this, the people around you flee in terror, some screaming that the gods are doing battle in the streets of Tenochtitlan. You maintain the stream of plasma, and it showers over Baal, who roars in rage and pain. Then incredibly, Baal begins to move through the air towards you, slowly but surely moving against the white-hot plasma that splashes like lightning across his chest. Amazed that anything can withstand such energy you are about to run in fear when Baal begins to show signs of strain. The plasma is getting through. The nimbus of yellow energy begins to flicker on and off. Then he drops out of the sky and slams into the floor of the plaza, his impact cracking the stonework. He lies there bellowing in rage as he struggles up, the yellow nimbus slowly re-forming around him. Awed, you realise he is only stunned and you run for Falcon's Wing, noting that your blaster energy pack is completely depleted. You will be unable to use it until you can fit another energy pack in Falcon's Wing. Turn to 285.</p>
