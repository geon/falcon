<p>Quickly, you leave the warehouse, detector tripod in hand, Blaster hidden in the folds of your clothes. You are on a paved street, lined with dark and brooding buildings, all industrial in some way. It is night on Dustbowl. Looking through the transparent Dome of Refuge you see the night sky, scattered with unfamiliar constellations and strange stars. The street seems deserted except for some large automated hovcars that stop at certain points, marked with posts fortunately labelled in Fedspeak. You examine the nearest post. It says 'Refuge Transport Hovbus'. A few moments later a large hovcar hums to a stop beside you and its doors slide open. The computer driver grates, in slightly archaic Fedspeak: 'What is your destination?' You reply that you would like to be taken to see the whaling port and it says 'Providence Airlock, Sir. That will be 130 credits. Please insert your card.'Hoping that CAIN has done its work properly, you pass your credit card through the data processor and sit in the hovbus. The only other passengers are three drunken whalers and a.few other Dustbowlers, dressed in robes of varying dark shades. Soon you are at the Providence Airlock where you hire a filter mask to cover your nose and mouth before stepping into the airlock that leads to the lift, after paying a small toll. Turn to 90.</p>
