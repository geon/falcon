<p>McReady's eyes roll up into his head. Suddenly a small suppurating hole appears in his neck, opening and closing spasmodically. His skull splits open with a loud wet crack and something large and bulky shudders forth, forming into a heavy head, horned and armoured, two small pig-like eyes at each side, the whole thing spilling rivulets of reddish mucus. Horrified, Achov and Caleb hesitate. McReady's shoulders split apart and a bony carapace forms over them. Then a thin jet of dirty white liquid hisses from the hole in the neck and streams towards you, Bragg and Achov. Almost as one you duck. Caleb raises the flamethrower, but McReady's side bursts open and a length of ridged, slime-ridden bone shoots out with devastating speed and buries itself in Caleb's chest. He howls in agony as, in front of your eyes, the bone begins to fuse with Caleb, retracting slowly, drawing him to the thing. Achov, Braxton and you open fire in horror, but the creature turns and, putting its head down, smashes through the door and is away, taking Caleb's body with it. Turn to 166.</p>
