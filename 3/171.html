<p>You are not fast enough and one of the razor sharp horns on the body of the Warrior punctures your suit and gouges a wound into your arm. Lose 5 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you manage to remain on your feet. Just then a troop of red-furred Warriors charge into the room and straight at Baal, led by two of the rebel Nobles, still trying to defeat the intruder Baal. They use their laser pistols on him as the Warriors launch themselves into the attack. You make it to the exit and sprint down it. Baal's bellows of rage fill the cavern. You know it will only be a matter of minutes before Baal has dealt with the Cavers and is hot on your trail. Turn to 204.</p>
