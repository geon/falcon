<p>You set co-ordinates for Earth in 3033 AD and you are soon surrounded by the grey nothingness of null-space. You may lie in your Autodoc and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance during the journey. You rematerialise in the Eiger Vault and whilst a TIME maintenance team is replenishing Falcon's Wing's supply of polybdenum, you instruct CAIN to link up with the Eiger service computer to check for any news. CAIN reports that nothing new has occurred during your visit to Rigel Prime. You will have to continue your search. Which timehole will you travel to:</p>

			<table class="choices">
				
							<tr>
								<td>The colony planet, Dustbowl, where Bloodhound discovered the timehole disturbance, in 2764 AD, even if you have been to Dustbowl once already?</td>
								<td><a href="287.html">Turn to 287</a></td>
							</tr>

							<tr>
								<td>South America, Earth, 1409 AD, the time of the Aztecs, if you have not been there already?</td>
								<td><a href="22.html">Turn to 22</a></td>
							</tr>

							<tr>
								<td>North America, Earth, 1863 AD, the time of the American Civil War, if you have not been there already?</td>
								<td><a href="34.html">Turn to 34</a></td>
							</tr>
