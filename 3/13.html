<p>Taking the detector tripod, you leave Falcon's Wing, and set it up behind a white adobe house that is adorned with many bright flowers. As the white gem begins to glow brightly you explore its psionic emanations with your mind. You find it is registering the presence of a segment of the Rack. It is lying in one of the buildings near the Great Pyramid. Putting the tripod back in Falcon's Wing, you head towards the pyramid. As you near it the babble of many voices grows louder. Rounding a large stone building you are presented with an awesome sight. You are at the top of a flight of one of the many stone steps leading down to an enormous plaza, surrounding the Great Pyramid. The plaza is filled with thousands upon thousands, a teeming crowd of Aztecs. Most are dressed simply in feathered shirts or robes, others are dressed richly in brightly patterned robes and headdresses. The stairs that rise up the centre of the bricked pyramid are filled with hundreds of prisoners, almost naked, many covered in white down stuck to their bodies by their own blood. They are formed into a long column marching into the plaza itself. Aztec Eagle Knights, and Jaguar Knights, dressed in the skins of the jaguar from head to foot, are hemming them in. At the top of the pyramid are many black robed priests as well as what must be the Emperor Ahuitzotl, wearing the most incredible finery, with his retinue. The sight of what they are doing fills you with revulsion. Methodically the priests are laying the prisoners on a blood-encrusted stone slab, slashing open their chests with obsidian knives, ripping out their hearts and smearing them over the carved idols of their gods. From what your Translator can pick up, it is a sacrifice to the Sun God, Huitzilopochtli, the Lord of War. Horrified, you make your way through the crowd, towards the building housing the piece of the Rack. It is a low structure, with a large square entrance, hung with bright curtains. Two Jaguar Knights stand guard at either side. Not wishing to waste time in this place of death, you decide to Thinkstrike them in rapid succession. Turn to 311.</p>
