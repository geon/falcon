<p>Soon you are safe in your bay at the Eiger Vault, You call in a maintenance team to make the necessary repairs to Falcon's Wing whilst you reflect on what could have happened had you been wearing your battlesuit in the fight against Baal. You have two parts of the Rack now, you must search for the third. Your only clue is the timeline disturbances and the death of Kingfisher on the timehole on Cave. After the Maintenance Techs have completed their work, you set co-ordinates for Cave, in the year 432 AD. Turn to 205.</p>
