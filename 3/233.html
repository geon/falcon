<p>You find yourself unable to control the mind of the door guard, mainly due to his unusual fear of mental contact. His eyes widen with fear and astonishment and you hear a muffled curse and 'Evil Sorcery'. Suddenly the quiet alley is filled with the harsh, deafening cry of an electronic alarm. A moment later and you can hear the sound of many running footsteps. You have no choice but to flee. You dash down the alleyway as ten or more black robed figures burst out of the doorway. One of them points at you and says: 'It is the Time Traveller! Kill him, in the name of Baal!' Smothering your shocked surprise, you sprint away. Turn to 245.</p>
