<p>Ignoring the officer, you dash away from his men over the stone wall. There is a shout of anger but nobody pursues you. You run out into an open field to be greeted by an unexpected sight. 200 yards ahead is a small river, Union troops are pulling back across it. In front of them are a line of logs, carts and the like, behind which a row of Union troops are waiting. The small river disappears in the heavy wood that blankets Culp's Hill. Seeing you, some of the blue-coated soldiers open fire, and puffs of white smoke appear in front of them. As fast as you can, you try to throw yourself to the ground. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
