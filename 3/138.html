				<p>138</p>
<p>You drop into the long grass crying out in mock agony. You lie still, pretending to be dead. You can hear the repeated volleys of musketfire from the Union lines and the shrieks of the wounded and dying as the Confederates press home their attack. After they have gone, you risk a look. A brief hand-to-hand struggle ensues and then the blue coats fall back, the Confederates too exhausted to pursue for now. Suddenly, a movement catches your eye and a section of wood just disappears. Your holodetector no longer registers another Time Machine. It looks like Yelov has escaped. You make your way to Benner's Hill where, you are pleased to see Lynx waiting for you. 'I stopped his attempt on Ewell, but I couldn't prevent him reaching his Time Machine,' she says despondently. 'I was hoping you'd be there.' You tell Lynx what happened. 'Lucky to be alive, as usual, eh, Falcon? Anyway I must try to find him again. Thanks and good luck with the Baal mission.' Turn to 333.</p>
