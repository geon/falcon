<p>The fly being realises who you are and lets out a burbling shriek, and rises into the air, wings humming. The high priest turns to you points and says: There is the Time Traveller in our very midst, slay him!' Your arm is a blur as your blaster appears in your hand. You fire, playing the white-hot beam of your plasma pistol over the fly beast and the altar. It shrivels up like paper and the altar explodes, revealing masses of twisted instrumentation. At this, the worshippers go into a frenzy of hatred. You cut down several but they seem to be fearless and you are soon overwhelmed and ripped limb from limb by the fanatical worshippers of Baal.</p>
