<p>A little later Falcon's Wing is journeying through null-space towards the planet Cave, thousands of years in the past. During the journey you may rest in your Autodoc and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance. Rematerialising, you look at the camera screens. You are in a large underground cavern of dull grey rock. In places, the rock is lined with seams of some blue mineral. It is lit by a dim green glow, emanating from patches of a phosphorescent mossy fungus, growing around the cavern. At one end you can see a tunnel leading away, at the other you can see twenty or so humanoid figures, apparently excavating the rock. They are short and stocky, with two stumpy legs and four heavily muscled arms. Two of the arms end in massive claws that they use to tear at the rock. The other two arms end in four fingered hands, used to carry the rock away. They have huge eyes, and large ears like that of a bat's. A single nostril lies above a small, lipless mouth. Yellow fur with black stripes covers them from head to foot. They are tearing into the rock with incredible speed and single-mindedness, but seem to you to be unintelligent. You ask CAIN for information. 'Cave in 3033 AD is outside of the Federation, but it is a highly advanced society. Cave is rich in seams of blue magnestite, a natural mineral that acts like magnesium, burning very brightly. It is used by the Federation in Starship drives. However, at this time, Cave is at a stage of development akin to Earth's neolithic age. The planet's barren surface is too hot to bear life and its atmosphere provides no protection from the sun's rays. However, beneath the surface it is a maze of tunnels. Each tunnel complex is ruled by a Mother. The Mother lays eggs in a batch, that hatch into specialised individual organisms, broadly divided into Workers, Warriors and Nobles. Those you can see now are Burrowers, their only function is to build new tunnels. The Nobles are intelligent humanoids, the rest are only intelligent enough to follow orders. There is a strict caste system, like an insect hive, and each batch of eggs usually differ in fur colouring and tend to form into what would be called in Earth terms, tribes or clans. However, each batch owes complete loyalty to the Mother. Different tunnel complexes often make war on each other. The Cavers use sound and smell as their primary senses. Although their eyes are extremely sensitive to light, there simply isn't enough of it to make full use of this sense. We have arrived in the Darkhome tunnel complex, where the Cave of 3033 AD has reported timeline changes. My databanks tell me we have arrived in the middle of a civil war, the only one ever recorded in Cave history. The atmosphere has oxygen in it, Falcon, but with high levels of nitrogen. I'm afraid you will have to use your environment suit, in any case, Cavers do not wear clothing, so the Molecular Convertor cannot help you. Try not to get spotted by any Nobles, Falcon, the response to any nonDarkhome intruder is to attack and destroy at this period in Caver history.' Turn to 18.</p>
