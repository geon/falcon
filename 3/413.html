<p>You wait until the lights have dimmed and a blanket of silence has fallen over the Dome, save for the quiet thrum of the generators. You creep up the corridor. Light seeps out from around Achov's door. He is still up. As you pass his room you hear a faint sound, as if of a muffled shriek from far away and a soft squelching sound. Suppressing your curiosity, you come to the lab and, opening the door, you glide in silently. You turn on a lamp and search the lab in the dim light. To your consternation you cannot find the Rack segment anywhere, but you do find the egg. It has split open and a thick reddish mucus has spread from it, dripping onto the floor of the lab with a slow, rhythmic splatter. You stare at it, fascinated, for several long seconds. Suddenly there is a sound behind you and you spin to face it. At the doorway stands Tsu Tsang, looking at you sideways, head cocked oddly, the light green pinpricks in her eyes. Her posture is rather stiff and jerky and an eerie shiver goes up your spine. She seems unnatural in some way. She steps towards you. Make a Chance Roll.</p>
<p>If you score 1, 3, 4 or 6, turn to 102</p>
