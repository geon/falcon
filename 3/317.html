<p>Hoping the mineral is magnesite, you unleash a blast of superhot plasma onto the pile of rocks. The reaction is instantaneous. The rock explodes, crumbling in the heat and producing an unbearable incandescent flare of bright blue light. Your face plate flash damper protects your eyes, but the Warriors are blinded instantly.
