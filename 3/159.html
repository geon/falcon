<p>The beam of your Particle Disruptor takes the raging Baal in the chest. He howls, a scream of terrific agony, and jumps back put of the line of fire, pained but essentially unhurt. It is incredible that he can withstand a Particle Disruptor, you think to yourself. Just then, several fly creatures slam into you, hurling you against the steel ceiling with frightening force. Subtract 4 from your battlesuit armour points as it takes a severe battering. If your armour score is at 0 or less, turn to 180. Otherwise, will you:</p>

								<td>Try to fight off the fly creatures?</td>
