<p>As you run back to the doorway you can hear a burbling shriek as the fly being realises who you are. You hurl yourself through the door into the silence of the night outside. You are forced to release the guard under your control, but he does manage to block the corridor for a brief moment. Suddenly, the quiet alley is filled with the harsh, deafening cry of an electronic alarm. A moment later and you can hear the sound of many running footsteps; You have no choice but to flee. You dash down the alleyway as ten or more black robed figures burst out of the doorway. One of them points at you and says: 'It is the Time Traveller! Kill him, in the name of Baal!' You sprint away. Turn to 245.</p>
