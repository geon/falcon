<p>You trigger a blast of superheated plasma and at this range, against such a large target, you cannot miss. He is bathed in a stream of white-hot plasma, splashing all over him and spluttering away to shatter the walls of the room. He roars in pain, and staggers back under the concentrated burst of fire, but you can tell, incredibly, that it is but temporary pain to him and that he is taking no serious damage. Your blaster energy reading is at 50% after the prolonged burst. Realising that you cannot stand against him (yet), you run as fast as you can for the plaza. There is a pause and then you can hear Baal smashing his way through the building in hot pursuit. Turn to 299.</p>
