<p>You dart past the outstretched arms of the large sailor and launch yourself through the air. The dust is so fine, you sink into it like a stone. You come to a stop, your breath held. You cannot see anything at all, opening your eyes would be useless anyway, even if you could. You realise 'you are not rising to the surface and that you will have to try to swim upwards, but you have no sense of direction in this morass of dust. Make a Chance Roll.</p>
