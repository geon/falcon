<p>Some hours later, you are rested and sitting in Jobanque's office, relating the story of your mission to your Section Chief. When you have finished he says: 'A remarkable tale, Falcon. You are indeed our most resourceful agent. Once again, the Federation indeed all the peoples of the known universe - owe their freedom to you. Who knows what crimes Baal would have perpetrated in his lust for ultimate power! The Cavers have had some unfortunate changes in their past, but they know you prevented the situation from getting worse. Much worse. The government of Cave, that is to say, the reigning Mother, has sent her personal thanks to you. However, not all the news is good. Agent Lynx is in hospital; she was on Yelov's trail, but he got the better of her. He's still at large somewhere, but keeping very quiet. Anyway, go and have some rest now Falcon, you've earned it!' A few days later, you receive a message asking you to go and see Jobanque again. When you arrive, you can see maintenance men going in and out of his office. Going in you can see it is being cleared out.</p>
<p>Jobanque is standing behind his desk, directing operations. Seeing you he says, 'Falcon, good to see you.' He pauses for a moment, smiling at you'. Then he says, 'I've been kicked upstairs, Falcon. They've selected me to be the Earther Lord of TIME, along with Silvermane, Pilota and R1llk of the Keladi! I've also got something for you, Falcon,' and he hands you a sheet of paper. It is an official TIME document. Your heart leaps as you realise you have been promoted to Section Chief, taking over from Jobanque's position. 'Agents Bloodhound, Lynx, Leopard, Chameleon and the rest are all under your command now, Falcon,' Jobanque says happily. 'Congratulations, Section Chief! Before you go, I've one last surprise for you,' and he opens the door. Standing there, grinning, is Braxton Bragg, looking a little older, but much the same, preserved by life-prolonging drugs. He smiles warmly and grabs your hand, shaking it vigorously.</p>
<p>'Good to see you again, after all these years. Falcon. Jobanque has told me all about it. I've always wondered who you were, a Time Traveller, eh! Never would've guessed it back on Chill in a million years.' You leave the TIME building together. He tells you he owns the Mining Company now and you reminisce about what he calls the 'Old Days' together, That thing certainly gave us a hard time, eh, Falcon.' But, of course, for him it was fifty-eight years ago, whilst for you it has only been a matter of days....</p>
