<p>You head down the gloomy tunnels illuminated by the green phosphorescence of the moss. Soon you come out into another Darkhome farm. You are following a path cutting through the middle of two lines of vats, fungus fields stretching away to either side. Some twenty metres ahead is the yawning black hole of the exit. Thick blue seams of some mineral line the walls above it. Some of the blue mineral has fallen in a small pile of crumbled rock near the entrance. Picking the rock up, you are able to identify it as magnesite. You may keep some if you wish. Note it on your Agent Profile. Leaving the farm area you continue on in search of the Rack section. Turn to 290.</p>
