<p>Your Particle Disruptor is able to function in this sea, and it vaporises the dust in its path. You must have hit it as your battlesuit sonic sensors are filled with a high pitched screaming sound and the large blip on your radar begins to veer away. As fast as you can you get back to Falcon's Wing. Quickly you fire your Particle Disruptor, severing the hausers connected to Falcon's Wing and then get inside it. As far as Captain Cresap Ord is concerned, when he draws up the severed hauser, it will appear that you have died in an unfortunate accident. Turn to 260.</p>
