<p>You see the ship moored at the harbour is the Dustskate. You walk up the gangplank. A sailor, supposedly on watch, is snoring loudly, sitting with his back to one of the harpoon guns. The Dustskate carries two on port and starboard. Gently you wake him and ask for the captain. Irritably, he points the way to his cabin and goes back to sleep. Knocking on the door and entering, you see a burly red-bearded man, going to fat, his feet upon the desk, talking to another man he calls the Bo'sun. 'What can I do for you, Offworlder?' he says. You explain to him your intention to hire Dustskate for a scientific expedition and the details of your fictitious corporation. He nods, turning to the Bo'sun he says, These Offworlders are quite mad of course, but their money is good, eh? Sure we'll take you. 2,000 placs now, 5,000 when we return. Deal?' You pay him the money and he arranges for your 'diving bell' to be loaded aboard. He introduces himself as Captain Cresap Ord, and soon the Dustskate is under way, its great sails unfurled, skudding out across the Sea of Dust. You notice one or two of the men eyeing you strangely, and you resolve to be on your guard. You are shown to your cabin, a functional steel room with one low bunk against the far wall. Taking no chances, you decide to sleep with your blaster under the pillow. Turn to 43.</p>
