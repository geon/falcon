<p>You step out into the Control Room. Caleb is waiting for you there and he smiles a greeting. Then his eyes widen in surprise. Suddenly, something sweeps across your legs, knocking you to the ground. Looking around, you see a set of several long human like arms, charred and burnt, heaving a bloated body out from under the lift. It had been clinging to the bottom of the lift. A crocodile head, jaws snapping, rears up above you, dripping slimy juices. Caleb rushes in and sprays it with flame, giving you time to scramble away. But then another spear of sharpened bone lashes out from the creature, even as it burns. Caleb is too slow to avoid it and it buries itself in his head, killing him instantly. The bony spear detaches itself from the flaming mass and begins to disappear into Caleb's body, transforming it. Quickly you use your flamethrower. You burn it thoroughly, making sure there is nothing left but charcoal. Then you use your blaster to reduce the lift to molten metal, sealing anything that may be left of the creature in the mine. Saddened by the death of Caleb, who saved your life, you leave the Control Room. Turn to 147.</p>
