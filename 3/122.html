<p>You notice that Tsu Tsang is not limping. There seems to be something odd about her, not quite right. Instinctively you draw your blaster, backing up, a sixth sense in your brain sending alarm signals up and down your body. Suddenly there is a sickening, tearing sound and Tsu Tsang's chest rips apart loudly, blood and slime spraying everywhere. Several tentacles writhe out and twist forward, hissing and bubbling horribly. Her body jerks convulsively, the jaws crack open and her tongue, impossibly long, slithers out obscenely, splitting like ripe fruit into two pulpy appendages that form into stings like a scorpion's tail in front of your very eyes. Organic juices spurt and flow in rivulets. Utterly horrified, you stand transfixed with shock at what you are seeing, as slime ridden tentacles reach out for you. *Make a Power of Will Roll* as you try to regain control of your senses.</p>
