<p>You tell CAIN what happened on Cave. It reports that there have been substantial changes in the history of Cave, caused by Baal. 'In my opinion,' it goes on, 'Baal intended to rule over Darkhome and, using advanced technology, extend his control over the whole planet. From there he could breed a race of genetically engineered star-warriors and make war on the whole galaxy. But you have prevented that, Falcon, he will never win any more support on Cave now. In any case, I would compute that Baal is seriously worried about the possibility that the Rack may be re-assembled.' If you have three pieces of the Rack, turn to 241. If not, you have only one clue left, the timehole on Dustbowl where Monitoring reported the timeline disturbance. Turn to 287.</p>
