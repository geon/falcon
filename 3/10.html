<p>You set co-ordinates for Dustbowl 2764 AD and instruct CAIN to use the Variac Drive. Moments later your mind is searching through null-space for the psychic pattern that marks the timehole and soon you are guiding the navigational computers to Dustbowl. You rematerialise from the grey nothingness of null-space to a grey expanse of crates, machine tools and rows of indefinable apparatus. The cameras show a large warehouse, dark and gloomy, apparently empty. CAIN tells you that Falcon's Wing is disguised as a set of crates marked 'Eiger Corporation' and proceeds to give you an historical up-date: 'Dustbowl is a completely barren planet, devoid of life except for one spot in the planet's surface, an enormous crater, presumably caused by a huge asteroid. The crater, some 2000 miles in diameter, is able to retain an atmosphere and is filled with extremely fine dust, forming the Sea of Dust. Within the sea, various organic life forms are found. Initially Dustbowl was, not unnaturally, passed over for colonisation. However, in 2631 AD, there was a short internecine struggle within the colony of Ascension. A group of religious fanatics had attempted to overthrow the government. This group was exiled from Ascension, along with many others Ascension saw as undesirable. The exiles came to Dustbowl, the only place they could find, and have been here ever since. The original religion has all but died out by this time, apparently it involved some form of sacrifice. Dustbowl is now a thriving colony. Luckily the exiles found a native organism, the Dustwhale, a great source of income. Not only is its flesh consumed as a great delicacy on other worlds (especially Kelados), it was found that its oil was of vital importance in the manufacture of Anagathics, the life prolonging drugs so common in the Federation of 3033 AD, Falcon. The colony itself is noted for its repressive social laws and is thought by many to be "boring". We are currently in a warehouse in the only city on Dustbowl, called Refuge. The city is high up on the cliffs that surround the crater and is covered in an Environment Dome. People leave the Dome only to sail the Sea of Dust and hunt the whales.' You will have to go outside to set up and use the detector so you ask CAIN to activate the Molecular Convertor. CAIN instructs the Convertor to manufacture the clothes of a typical Dustbowl sailor, a dustwhaler. You emerge into the deserted warehouse clothed in thick, bulky, brown and white cloth, designed to keep out as much dust as possible. Soon you have the tripod in place. The strange luminescent gem begins to glow and you use your Psychic Awareness to explore its psionic emanations. Apparently, no part of the Rack is to be found within the city, but unfortunately Refuge's Environment Dome is preventing the detector from functioning outside the city. With a sigh of resignation you realise that you will have to go out of the city to make absolutely sure Baal has not been here. For this you will need more equipment, and you turn back to Falcon's Wing. The Mind Scanner goes green and you are drawn up into the cabin. Turn to 54.</p>
