<p>The one you know to be a disciple of Baal throws his head back, his face screwed up in pain and slumps to the ground. The other sailor stares at his prone body in astonishment. Taking no chances, you drive your fist at his temple, knocking him out instantly. You return to Falcon's Wing where you decide to wait until the Winged Demon has left on another whaling expedition, so you can find another ship. You instruct CAIN to disguise Falcon's Wing as a pile of whaling equipment to avoid the prying eyes of anyone in search of the scientist's diving bell. You may lie in your Autodoc if you wish, and gain up to 6 points of lost Endurance. Turn to 342.</p>
