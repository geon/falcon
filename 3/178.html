<p>Somehow Baal has detected your presence near the Rack segment. There is a snarl of ferocious rage as he continues his onslaught on the roof. You dash back towards the portal, as bricks and mortar cascade into the room. Before you have reached the doorway, Baal crashes through the roof into the room and comes to his feet on the floor. His weight sets off a trap and a volley of javelins fly at him, but they shatter against his skin as if they were made of sand. He hardly notices them. Do you have a piece of the Rack with small triangles at each corner with you, as well as the one you have just picked up? If you have, turn to 305. If you have not, turn to 320.</p>
