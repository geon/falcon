<p>You are unable to move as quickly as you would normally under this gravity. Before you can fire the Rigellian hurls a viciously barbed sphere from his belt. You are unable to throw yourself aside and it slams into your shoulder with superhuman force, knocking you to the ground. Desperately, you struggle to your feet but he is upon you. In a flash he has struck your head from your shoulders. You have failed.</p>
