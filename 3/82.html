				<p>82</p>
<p>A hushed silence falls, as Baal hangs there. Then, with a smile of pure evil, Baal gestures at the priests, the passage of his hand leaving a fading trail of crackling yellow energy. They leap up and frantically continue the sacrifice, offering the hearts up to what they believe to be their god. With a thrill of horror, you realise Baal is feeding off the life forces of the victims, using some kind of psychic vampirism. Even as you watch, he seems to grow stronger, raw energy flickering about him in everincreasing intensity. He throws back his head and laughs, a terrible booming sound that echoes around the plaza. If you are carrying a piece of the Rack, turn to 93. If you are not, turn to 111.</p>
