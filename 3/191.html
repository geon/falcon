<p>There is a howl of ferocious rage and bricks and mortar tumble into the room. You dash back to the portal but turn to stare at the sight that greets you. A huge twenty-foot figure has smashed its way through the roof. It is a powerfully muscled man, deep red in colour with slitted reptilian eyes and taloned fingers. A nimbus of yellow energy plays about its form. His weight sets off a trap and a volley of javelins fly from the wall, but they shatter against his skin as if they were made of sand. He hardly notices them. You recognise Baal. You guess he comes here to feed off the life forces of the sacrificial victims of the Aztecs, perhaps even masquerading as one of their gods. He glares at you balefully, his lips drawn back in a snarl of anger. You cannot help but tremble in fright, faced as you are with the primordial evil you can see in his eyes. He raises his arms, sweeping them across the ceiling, destroying more of the roof, yellow energy crackling and spitting all about him. Do you have a piece of the Rack with small triangles at each corner with you, as well as the one you have just picked up? If you have, turn to 305. If you have not, turn to 320.</p>
