<p>You have almost reached Falcon's Wing when some black-robed priests charge at you from a nearby alleyway, a fanatical gleam in their eyes, screaming, 'Death to the enemies of Huitzilopochtli!' However, they stop in disbelief when you disappear into the hologram; it looks to them as if you have passed through the wall of a house. Hurriedly, you set course for the Eiger Vault. Then the cameras reveal Baal, recovered, hurtling directly at you and your screens are filled with yellow flame as he unleashes a fireball engulfing Falcon's Wing. You scream at CAIN to engage the Variac Drive and, moments later, you disappear from the city of Tenochtitlan. Safe in the grey nothingness of null-space, you heave a sigh of relief, calming your shattered nerves. Soon you are floating on the Winds of Time headed for the Eiger Vault. You ask CAIN what has happened in the timelines, knowing that the first law of TIME has been broken on Tenochtitlan to an unprecedented degree. It replies that the society was almost completely wiped out by the Spaniards in a few more decades, thus cancelling any serious time change. You may lie in your Autodoc and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance on this journey. Have you been given any information about the Planet Cave? If you have, turn to 86. If you have not turn to 76.</p>
