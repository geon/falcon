<p>Bragg speaks, 'Right, it's it or us. We've got to hunt it down and kill it; if we just wait it'll come for us in our sleep or individually. There's only three of us now.'</p>
<p>'I agree,' says Achov. 'Let's do it.'</p>
<p>'Okay,' says Bragg. 'Let's go and get the powersuits, Lieutenant Falcon's battlesuit will be a great asset.' You all leave together, headed for the air-lock strong room. Unfortunately you discover all of the powersuits, including your battlesuit, have had their Central Processing Units ripped out. Achov rifles through the emergency spares box, 'Damn, the spares are gone too!' The suits are useless without their computers to guide them. You won't be able to leave the Dome until you find the suits' computer cartridges.</p>
<p>Bragg says: 'We'll just have to do without them. We'll flush it out: Achov, you take the right corridor. Lieutenant, you take the centre corridor, but don't descend into the mine itself, that would be too dangerous if it's there. I'll take the left tunnel. Well each take a short range radio on the same frequency. At the first sign of trouble, pull back to the junction and radio for help.' Bragg hands out the radios.</p>
<p>Achov gives you a flamethrower. 'This was Caleb's, he looked after it well. He was a good man, use it to avenge him.'</p>
<p>Bragg says, 'If we don't find it, it'll be in the mine itself. Then we'll go down and flush it out.' As you all head down the corridor you nip into your cabin. Quickly you take out the tripod and search for the Rack. You discover that it has been taken back to the Cavern at the end of the mineshaft. You will have to go down there after all despite Bragg's warning not to. Turn to 412.</p>
