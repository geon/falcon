<p>You materialise on the world of Dustbowl again. Examining the camera you see that you have not arrived within the domed city of Refuge this time, but at the port, on the edge of the Sea of Dust. This should mean that the priests of Baal will probably be unable to detect your presence. Crates and miscellaneous equipment are stacked nearby and to the left you can see a cluster of buildings. It is day time, and the white sun is directly overhead; the sky is maroon tinged with blue, and the air is filled with clouds of fine dust. Ahead of you stretches an endless red expanse, the Sea of Dust. Behind you and to either side, great rocky cliffs climb high above you, stretching out of sight. Perched somewhere at their top lies the city of Refuge. CAIN runs off the disguise of a Dustbowl whaler in the Molecular Convertor again, along with a filter mask and you step out, detector in hand. You look around, but no one is near. Setting the tripod up, you begin to explore its psychic emanations. You sense that it is registering the presence of a piece of the Rack! Your excitement fades though as you realise that it is lying out at sea, deep in the depths of the crater, buried under tons and tons of dust. It will prove difficult to get hold of. You decide to consult CAIN, and re-enter Falcon's Wing. Turn to 27.</p>
