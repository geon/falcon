<p>As you leave the artificial gravity of Falcon's Wing you are instantly struck by the heavy weight of twice the gravity you are used to. It is as if your limbs were made of lead and your breathing is heavy and laboured as you stagger into the cover of some nearby trees, half way up the side of the glade. As if in slow motion you set up the detector tripod. The dull whitish gem begins to radiate a translucent light and you use your Psychic Awareness to explore the psionic emanations of the detector. Within moments you realise that there are no traces of the Rack here on Rigel. As you are packing the detector up, a sound alerts you. Turning, you see a large humanoid figure, seven or eight feet tall, entering the glade. The figure is a Rigellian, obviously dressed for war. He looks much like Lord Silvermane save that his long, shoulder-length hair is jet black. He has blue skin, covered in strange designs painted on in yellow and white. His body is heavily muscled, the legs and arms are like tree trunks, the torso a barrel. In one three-fingered hand he holds an enormous club, a long spiked bar ending in a cluster of sharpened blades. His other arm is armoured from shoulder to hand with spiked steel, ending in a vicious dagger-like blade coming from the top of the wrist. From a wide belt hang several wickedly pointed throwing weapons. The eyes, all white, glare balefully around the glade. You sink slowly into the cover of the trees, hoping not to be spotted. Unfortunately, the Rigellian is now between you and Falcon's Wing. Then there is a sound to your left and another enormous figure, less stocky than the other, but with a hint of tigerish grace, enters the glade. His hair is bluey-green, in one hand he holds what would be to a human a halberd, which serves as a one bladed axe to the Rigellian. In his other hand is one long blade, a hand grip in its middle. His abdomen is covered in linked plates of mail with a spike at the front. Turn to 78.</p>
