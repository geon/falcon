<p>Realising you cannot stand against him (yet), you dash away, running as fast as you can for the Plaza outside. Baal gives a deep throated rumbling growl, rising to a crescendo of roaring thunder, raising the hackles on the back of your neck as you flee, almost in abject terror. He smashes through the portal of the room behind you, and begins to crash through the building towards you. You are sprinting for the curtained entrance when he crashes through a nearby wall and, picking up a large chunk of rock, hurls it at you as if it were a pebble. Make an Evasion Roll</p>
