<p>You take the star-shaped Rack and send it spinning through the air towards Baal. It leaves a shimmering trail of light behind it as it arcs down, whining shrilly. Baal's eyes widen in horror and he screams once more, 'Noooo, not again, please!' Suddenly the Rack splits into four and each section arrows away to fasten at Baal's wrists and ankles. He is powerless as the Rack spreadeagles him, lifting him, cartwheeling around, into the air. The fly creatures halt in mid-air, hovering, unsure without the driving will of their master behind them. Each triangle begins to shimmer and crackle with white light. Then streaks of white lightning flash from triangle to triangle, enmeshing Baal in bands of bright energy. Soon he disappears from view, completely enclosed in a prison of pure elemental energy. Suddenly the whole thing disappears. The fly creatures flutter downward, purposeless. At last you have succeeded, you turn and jet back to Falcon's Wing. You tell CAIN to set co-ordinates for the Eiger Vault in a tired voice, your mission complete. Turn to 420.</p>
