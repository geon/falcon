<p>Ahead of you is a large log of wood. A blue jacketed man leaps up behind it and thrusts at you with his bayonet. You grab it and knock him senseless with a blow to his neck. Leaping over the log you find yourself in a hand-to-hand struggle with another Union soldier. All around, small knots of men are struggling desperately. Another Union soldier gashes your thigh with his bayonet, in the melee. Lose 8 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you drop to one knee and your opponent is about to finish you off when the Union line breaks and he is forced to flee. A cheer goes up, but the Confederates are too tired to pursue them. Tearing a strip of cloth from your shirt, you bind up your wound. Suddenly, a movement catches your eye and a section of wood just disappears. Your holo-detector no longer registers another Time Machine. It looks like Yelov has escaped. You have to wait a few hours until nightfall before you can get away from the Confederate soldiers, who make no further attacks that day. You make your way to Benner's Hill/where you are pleased to see Lynx is waiting for you. 'Where have you been, Falcon? I was worried. I stopped Yelov's attempt on Ewell, but I couldn't prevent him reaching his Time Machine,' she says despondently. 'I was hoping you'd be there.' You tell Lynx what happened. 'Lucky to be alive, as usual, eh, Falcon? Anyway I must try to find him again. Thanks and good luck with the Baal mission.' Turn to 333.</p>
