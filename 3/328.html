<p>You draw your blaster and fire in one smooth motion. A bolt of plasma slams into McReady's leg, smashing him against the door. He howls, an unearthly, inhuman sound, and his eyes roll up into his head. Suddenly a small suppurating hole appears in his neck, opening and closing spasmodically. His skull splits open with a loud wet crack and something large and bulky shudders forth, forming into a heavy head, horned and armoured, two small pig-like eyes at each side, the whole thing spilling rivulets of reddish mucus. Horrified, Achov, Bragg and Caleb hesitate. McReady's shoulders split apart and a bony carapace forms over them. Then a thin jet of dirty white liquid hisses from the hole in the neck and streams toward you. Desperately you try to avoid it. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
