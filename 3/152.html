<p>You unleash a bolt of mental energy at Baal, but he hardly even pauses as he hurls the corpse of the Warrior at you with punishing force, brushing aside your mental assault almost as an afterthought. Caught off guard the body slams into you, sending you crashing to the ground. Luckily none of its sharp protuberances have cut you, but the impact has cracked one of your ribs. Lose 4 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you rise to your feet. If you have the severed hand-blade of a Caver Warrior in your possession, turn to 163, if not read on. Baal grabs another body as if it were a rag doll. You dash for the exit as he hurls it at you. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
