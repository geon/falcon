<p>There is a grunt of pain and the eyes disappear from view for a moment. Then they are back, wide with fear and astonishment, and you can hear a muffled curse and: 'Evil sorcery!' It seems superstition is rife in Refuge in 2764 AD. Then he is gone. You are about to force the door when suddenly the quiet alley is filled with the harsh, deafening cry of an electronic alarm. A moment later and you can hear the sound of many running footsteps. You have no choice but to flee. You dash down the alleyway as ten or more black robed figures burst out of the doorway. One of them points at you and says: 'It is the Time Traveller! Kill him, in the name of Baal!' Smothering your shocked surprise, you sprint away. Turn to 245.</p>
