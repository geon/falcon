<p>You have misjudged how close your pursuers were. You unleash a blast of superheated plasma that virtually vaporises two of them but another slams into you, wielding a wickedly curved dagger.

This gives you enough time to run on. They seem hesitant to follow you now, and soon you have left them behind.

Obviously they knew a short cut. Acting instinctively, you hurl yourself, rolling, at the feet of your four assailants, hoping to trip them and run on into the safety of Falcon's Wing.
