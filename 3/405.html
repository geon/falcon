<p>Desperately, you throw your most powerful blast of mental energy at the creature, but it has no effect, you can sense it has no mind at least not what you would call a mind. You utter a shriek of revulsion as a tentacle snakes wetly around your thigh. Your leg begins to burn agonisingly as you realise the slime that coats it is eating into your flesh. Lose 3 Endurance points and subtract 1 from your Evasion Modifier permanently as the wound will never heal properly. If you still live, you whip out your blaster as fast as you can and fire at the thing as it writhes in front of you. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
