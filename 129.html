<p>Your shock wave of thought topples one of the lancers from the saddle and Bloodhound and Lynx have been similarly successful with two of the other lancers. The remaining one catchesLynx in the shoulder before she can topple him with the power of her thought, but she grabs the lance and swings herself up on it, kicking the lancer in the face. He tumbles, unconscious, from the saddle but Lynx falls beside him. She is badly wounded and has to return to her Autodoc. She urges you to go on, saying: 'I'll see you at the Eiger Vault Rec Centre,' and wishes you luck before limping away. You run to catch up with the ambulance. Turn to 251.</p>
