EARTH 3033 AD
A third of the land's surface is populated with cities which stretch miles up towards the Ionosphere and are also tunnelled deep into the Earth's crust.
The world is united - war within the atmosphere of a single planet can only lead to total destruction. Government is carried out by Executives, each having full powers within a certain area. The Food, Health, Pleasure and Enforcement Executives are centred in Alpolis, a city covering what was once an independent country - Switzerland - and it is here that the most recent Executive, TIME, exists.
People live for fun, not to work. Most tasks are performed by robots so life is quite easy. Only 10% of the population still works, and then only for fun or out of a sense of social duty. Food is plentiful, the main source being a fungus grown in huge vats under artificial light. Luxury foods, such as meat, are a rarity. Communications have improved so as to transform society: holophones connect all homes across the Space Federation so it is possible to be in direct contact with many alien species light years across space. Travel on Earth is done by hovrail, jetcopter or stratocruiser, so that the longest journey need take no more than an hour.
The average Earther lives for two hundred and fifty years and the ageing process only begins during the last fifty years of life. Life-prolonging drugs, called Anagathics, are freely available, and transplant surgery is now a simple operation. Un- fortunately, because people live longer, there are many problems. There is overcrowding and very little to do which has resulted in a rapid increase in violent crime. With so many people needing new hearts, lungs and other organs there is a shortage of spare parts for use in transplant surgery and the Enforcement Executive has passed a Termination Code. All violent crimes are punishable by painless death. The Enforce- ment Executive has had sensors set up to catch criminals, especially Bodybrokers who deal illegally in organs for surgery.

 If Energy Weapons are used by criminals, for instance, a police jetcopter will be there in seconds.
Earth, using Hyperdrive, faster-than-light travel, has estab- lished itself as head of the Space Federation, which includes all the earth colonies and alien planets. The Navy patrols the colonies: Lastlanding, Proxima Centauri, Ascension and so on, as well as the alien worlds: Kelados, Sundew, Dyskra, Clyss, Rigel Prime, the Hive and others. Contact with alien life forms is commonplace and the colony ships of the twenty-fourth century are still approaching the centre of the galaxy.
How to Travel in Time
Travel through time involves crossing a fourth dimension, 'Null-space' or the 'Void' as it is known. This dimension joins all points in time and Space from the beginning of the universe to its end. Imagine time as a cable. Earth's Timeline (or past, present and future) is a single strand of this cable stretching from Earth's beginning to the end of time. The Timelines of other planets run alongside this and weave around each other, because events on one planet affect things on another. These strands, or Timelines, are insulated from the fourth dimension in the same way that an electrical wire is insulated. At certain points there are holes in the insulation allowing travel from one point on the wire through this hole to a different point on this or another wire. In this way a Time Machine may move from one 'Timehole' to another and from one point in space to another via Null-space.
The Timeholes are formed when the fabric of time is damaged by unknown forces. They can be larger, but are usually less than five miles across. Timeholes come and go as new damage occurs and older Timeholes close up naturally. The Monitoring Section is responsible for keeping the map of current Timeholes. Your up-to-date map is opposite. At least one hole has been there for a long time - the Eiger Vault, near the TIME Building in the Alps. It is thought to be a permanent Timehole and your Time Machine, Falcon's Wing, is kept there along with those of the Lords of TIME and other Agents. Some Timeholes are safer than others and it is possible to go back in time only to find that the hole through which you travelled has closed up, trapping the

unfortunate traveller in the past. Time passes at the same rate in all Timeholes as on Earth. If you begin a journey to a Timehole ten minutes after somebody else does you will arrive ten minutes later than them. Only those with Psychic Awareness can navigate across Null-space.
Game Rules
ATTACK
In certain paragraphs you will have the chance to attack an enemy. When you choose to do so, you will be asked to make an Attack Roll. To do this, roll two dice and add the numbers together. You will be told which paragraph to turn to next, depending on your score. In all combats you are more likely to succeed if your score is high than if it is low.
ATTACK MODIFIER
Whenever you make an Attack Roll you must add or subtract your Attack Modifier to the dice score. Your Attack Modifier may change as the adventure unfolds and you should keep a note of this on your Agent Profile (at the beginning of the adventure). To begin with your Attack Modifier is zero.
EVASION
In certain cases you may need to avoid the attack of an enemy or
escape from a difficult situation. You will be asked to make an
Evasion Roll, to which you must add or subtract your Evasion
Modifier. This works in the same way as the Attack Roll and
Attack Modifier as described above. Your initial Evasion Modifier is also zero.
CHANCE
There are moments in any agent's career when pure luck will
play its part. On such occasions you will be asked to make a
Chance Roll. Roll one die. You will then be instructed to turn to a new paragraph.
POWERS OF THE MIND
Some paragraphs will offer you the chance to make a mental attack, either a Thinkstrike or Power of Will. Make an Attack Roll, just as if you were attacking normally, but add or subtract your Thinkstrike or Power of Will Modifier, not your Attack
Modifier. In all other ways mental attacks work in the same way as a physical attack. To begin with your Thinkstrike and Power of Will Modifiers are zero, as noted on your Agent Profile.
PSYCHIC AWARENESS
Your Psychic Awareness operates at all times and you will be told when you have discovered anything of interest.
ENDURANCE
You, Falcon, start the adventure with 20 points of Endurance. If you are wounded in combat, suffer something unpleasant such as an acid atmosphere without a space suit, or become exhausted, you will lose Endurance points. A running total of your Endurance should be kept on your Agent Profile. If at any time you fall to zero Endurance or less you are dead and your adventure is over. Endurance points can be regained by visiting the Autodoc in your Time Machine (see equipment list) and you will be told when you can use your Autodoc.
SCORING
You will notice as you use this book that certain paragraph numbers are followed by a letter in brackets. If you wish to score your performance as Special Agent Falcon, you will need to make a list of the letters following these numbers on the box provided on your Agent Profile every time you come to one of these paragraphs. If you should be killed or fail in your adventure, you should delete your current recorded letters except for all the Qs which must be kept and begin again. Each letter corresponds to a score, and you will be given a rating, depending on what the total of your score is. The letter scores may be found at the back of the third book of this series, The Rack of Baal. This is necessary, since printing the scores in this book would allow you to find out what the right decisions to take in this adventure are! The scores for Falcon 1: The Renegade Lord, may be found at the back of this book.
Special Rules
The action in Falcon 2: Mechanon, carries straight on from Falcon 1: The Renegade Lord. If you have played Falcon I, transfer the modifier scores from your Agent Profile in that book, to the Agent Profile in the beginning of this one. It is not essential to

STRIKE FIGHTER STRIKE FIGHTER
  
play Falcon 1 first, but information you may gain while playing it may help you to complete this mission successfully. If you have not played falcon 1 then all of your modifiers begin at zero.
Strike Fighter and Starship Trooper Battlesuit
During falcon Book 2, you may be issued with a Weeks/Senior Corporation Space Navy Strike Fighter and a standard issue battlesuit. These have 10 Defence points each. When you take damage in the Strike Fighter or battlesuit, you will be told to lose a certain number of points. Simply cross off the relevant amount in the box provided on your Agent Profile. The Strike Fighter also begins with four fission warhead guided missiles of enormous power. Each time you use one cross it off the relevant part of your Agent Profile.
Equipment
Standard Issue For TIME Special Agents
ITEM 1: MODEL A3 TIME MACHINE [see accompanying
specifications]
Your own Time Machine, Falcon's Wing, is silver with bright scarlet markings and is the eleventh machine capable of travel through time ever built. Its cost cannot be computed, since it involves the use of certain materials and scientific skills which are priceless. The silver and scarlet hull will withstand enormous pressure, heat and exposure to harmful gases and liquids, as well as providing protection from radiation.
The six hydraulic legs which support the machine are extended when it materialises in a new Timehole, to provide stability on uneven ground. The Main Access is operated by invisible Tractor Beams (energy beams that can be used to grip and lift) that will draw the Time Traveller up into the cabin, to rest on the Access Disc. This disc is matter but is changed to air as you move through it by the Molecular Converter (see Item 4). The pressurised cabin is lined with instruments and gadgets. The crash couch is moulded to fit your shape and can be moved up to the command console or up into the Flyer (see Item 6).
The air inside the machine is kept pure by the life support unit and can be flushed out and replaced within ten seconds. The Main Access will work only when its Memory Scanner
recognises your own brain patterns. Specially sensitive cameras and power floodlights are mounted on top of the Machine. The Viriac Drive, which forces the Machine into Null-space, is housed beneath the deck and is controlled through your computer (CAIN, see Item 7).
ITEM 2: HOLOGRAM GENERATOR
Each Time Machine is equipped with a Hologram Generator - very important if the First Law of TIME is to be obeyed. The
Generator changes the appearance of the Machine by casting a hologram around it, so the computer can make the Machine look like a small wood, hayrick or grassy hill etc, which is very lifelike unless you are within two metres of the Machine itself. This stops people in history being curious at the sight of a highly technological machine.
ITEM 3: HOLO-DETECTOR
Due to the existence of Hologram Generators you may find it difficult to see other Time Machines. As a member of the Time Police you have been given a Hologram-detector which is portable and operates to a range of fifty metres. This will reveal the presence of a hologram and therefore another Time Machine.
ITEM 4: MOLECULAR CONVERTOR
Each Time Machine is equipped with a Molecular Converter, a device which uses the rarest of all elements, Polybdenum, as its fuel. Small articles, placed in the Converter, are transformed into whatever the computer decides. In this way, Time Travellers have disguises which allow them to pass undetected amongst the intelligent beings of other times. CAIN, your computer, carries information about the Timeholes shown on your map, so that the blueprints required by the Converter to make the disguises accurate are usually available. Your Psionic
Helmet, for instance, can be turned into a legionary's helmet, while keeping its modern powers.
ITEM 5: AUTODOC
This is a couch-like device which has needles, a drip, a blood supply and surgical robo-arms. You may lie in the Autodoc during the time taken to travel from one Timehole to another,

TIME MACHINE TIME MACHINE
  
STARSHIP TROOPER BATTLESUIT
for instance, and come out healed, restoring your Endurance by up to twelve points. You will be told when you can use your
Autodoc.
ITEM 6: FLYER [see accompanying specification]
Your crash-couch swivels up onto the platform of your flyer when you wish to use it. The flyer is a small hover raft which is catapultedout of the Time Machine through the Launch Doors, two sections on top of the hull that slide apart. Once safely away from the Machine the Ion Drive can be cut in, giving the flyer a top speed many times the speed of sound (Mach 6). It can hover which allows you to use it as an observation platform, but it is too small to carry a Hologram Generator and should only be
used when strictly necessary. Fortunately, its Ion Drive is almost soundless. You are also issued with a Homing Beacon, which, when activated, will make the flyer move to its location as quickly as possible. The flyer is then piloted by its micro computer. The Beacon is magnetic, and about the size of a die.
ITEM 7: CAIN [Cybernetic Artificial Intelligence Nexus] CAIN is one of the most advanced computers known to man. Its data banks offer information on all subjects and historical data on all Federation and alien planets. Its memory banks are continuously updated with information concerning the Time- holes and it is able to link with the massive memory banks of the TIME Service Computer at the Eiger Vault. A Holophone,
through which you can contact any other Holophone in the Federation, is built into CAIN and you also have access to most of the files kept by TIME. CAIN answers your spoken commands and runs the Time Machine for you. It can give information visually, via the terminal screen, or verbally, using its melodic chimes.
ITEM 8: BLASTER [see accompanying specifications]
This is your Standard Starship Trooper issue Plasma Pistol. It fires superheated plasma to a range of 100 metres, and the Energy Pack is sufficient for ten minutes continuous use. You have more Energy Packs in your weapons locker. Your blaster is labelled. Tor use in exceptional circumstances only'.

PSIONIC ENHANCER
ENVIRONMENT SUIT
  
ITEM 9: PSIONIC ENHANCER [see accompanying specification] This helmet helps your Powers of the Mind by damping all other thoughts. It senses when you want to use your power and activates automatically.
ITEM 10: ENVIRONMENT SUIT
A light, pressurised suit for use in vacuum, inhospitable atmospheres and extreme ranges of temperature and which monitors your life signals such as pulse and temperature. It is compatible with your Psionic Enhancer.
Personal Background
Special Agent (TIME)
Codename: Falcon
For three years you have studied at the Academy as a cadet attached to TIME: the Temporal, Investigative and Monitoring Executive, and you have passed the difficult training programme with flying colours. You have been selected from the Academy to be a Special Agent because of your unusual talents having been born with Powers of the Mind: you can sense things that others can't and even influence their actions through thought alone. These powers have been strengthened and focussed during your training and you have been issued with a Psionic Enhancer, a helmet which increases these mental powers. You have been taught to attack the minds of others with a blast of mental energy you call Thinkstrike. Your Power of Will allows you to control the minds of those weaker than you, and your Psychic Awareness allows you to sense things that others cannot, including the presence of another with such mental powers. This Psychic Awareness also lets you navigate your Time Machine through time and space. Few have such powers and even fewer are trusted with one of the small number of Time Machines in existence.
You are expert in survival techniques including armed and unarmed combat. History and detective powers of deduction have also been major subjects of study. You are now an Agent in the Time Police, whose job is to guard the Timelines of the past and to ensure that no-one tampers with past events in any way that would change things as they are now.
TIME, the Temporal Investigative and Monitoring Executive, was set up in Alpolis forty years ago shortly after Time Travel was discovered. The realisation that anyone with access to Time travel could change the past so that the entire human race might cease to exist was worrying, so Time Machines were built for the Time Police in their crystal domed TIME headquarters, in order to stop this. TIME is headed by five Lords, representing the most powerful groups in the Space Federation. Each of these have Powers of the Mind, and their own Time Machine.
the Executive is divided into four sections: Administrative, Research, Monitoring and the Special Agent Section (or SAS). the Monitoring Section, headed by Section Chief Jobanque, is responsible for noting any disturbances in the past, or timelines, of the planets in the Federation. The Research Section, headed by Section Chief Skirrow, is responsible for all equipment used by Special Agents and is also examining the possibilities of travel into the future, as yet impossible. Your own Special Agent Section is headed by Section Chief Agidy
Yelov, a Siriun humanoid from the Federation member planet, - Sirius Secundus. Agidy Yelov and others have told you the importanceof the First Law of TIME when on active service: 'A
TIME Agent must, in all cases, act naturally according to the time in which he is currently operating, thus minimising any disruption of the Timelines his or her presence might be causing'. As Yelov once said to you: There's no point in coming back to 3033 if you have left an atomic hand gun near Hitler's bunker, because this would change the present - in fact, you'd probably find you had never existed!'. As with all Special Agents, your bloodline has been traced back, in your case to the French Revolution in 1789AD. Should any one of your ancestors fail to produce the next in line it would be as if you had never existed.

Hints on Play
The rules are very simple - you could almost play this book without reading them at all. But reading the Personal Background and, of course, the Mission Brief will help you to understand what is happening as you begin the adventure. If you come across something you don't understand, don't worry, check the Equipment List and this may give you a clue. If not, carry on anyway, it will probably come clear later.

Good luck, and remember, the fate of the Space Federation rests in your hands.

Subject: THE RENEGADE LORD
SPECIAL AGENT FALCON SAVES THE FEDERA TION
Twelve days ago, Agidy Yelov, once head of the Special Agent Section of the TIME Executive was made the subject of a Termination Order by the Enforcers.
His crime - aiding the Hiver beings in a bid to seize control of Earth and the Space Federation.
Special Agent Falcon, formerly under the command of Yelov, was responsible for foiling a complex plot to change the course of history using Time Travel. The Keladi Lord of TIME was assassinated and the Hiver Lord of TIME attempted to slow the development of civilisation on Earth by allowing the Mongol horde to overrun Europe in the 13th century. When Falcon thwarted this, he moved through time to change history in Napoleonic times at the battle of Borodino.
Falcon preserved history unchanged, even though Yelov had ordered two other agents of TIME, Bloodhound and Lynx, to kill their colleague.
This courageous and resourceful agent at last cornered the Renegade Lord on planet Hel where a meeting with Yelov had been planned. Falcon destroyed the Hiver Lord and brought Yelov to justice.
Agidy Yelov, a Siriun, has pleaded 'Uncontrolled Actions' saying that the Hiver Lord of TIME had used its Powers of the Mind to force him to do its bidding. Yelov is under stay of execution until further information is received from the Hive, homeworld of the dead Renegade Lord.
There remain only three Lords of TIME, heading the TIME Executive and of these, the Earther, Lord Speke, has been disgraced. Pilota, the Lastlander solar racer, and Lord Silver- mane of Rigel Prime are presently in command. New appointments are expected soon. Jobanque of the Monitoring Section has replaced Yelov as head of the Special Agent Section. Special Agent Falcon has been awarded the Golden Wings, the highest honour the Space Federation can give. We all owe our lives to Falcon.
Complete Datadump in our next update.

# Mission Brief
As you walk into the recreation centre, under its glasteel dome at the top of the TIME Building, you hear the deep booming voice of Special Agent Bloodhound. You nod to some operatives from the monitoring section and, passing the empty dream booths, head towards the voice.
Unusually, all except one of the SAT team, the Special Agents of TIME, are off duty together. A celebration day has been given in honour of the success of your mission against the renegade Lord. The agents are involved in a historical simulation of diplomatic intrigue; occasionally one or other of them types on the micro-terminal you all carry in place of a watch, and they examine a hovering globe screen to see the results of each move. Bloodhound looks up and says, 'Here's glory hunter, on-line Falcon! Won any more medals since yesterday?'
Lynx smiles sardonically, 'Don't let the fact that Falcon won the Golden Wings straight out of the Academy ruffle your calm, Blood.'
'Oh well, at least I wasn't Yelov's golden girl,' he replies. Agidy Yelov trained Lynx himself and she is more deadly at unarmed combat than any of you, but she laughs at Bloodhound's jibe.

Agent Sparrowhawk says quietly, 'No-one has proven that Agidy was a traitor yet.' Like Yelov, she is a Siriun, and an electronics genius. Her feline features quiver momentarily as she turns on her heel and glides, cat-like, towards a dream booth.
'It's bad for morale, losing a boss like this,' says Lynx.
Sparrowhawk looks back and says, 'Don't you think it is worse for Agidy? They had to rebuild half of him, he's as much a droid as a man.'
The other agent at the table, Leopard, who himself is no more than a living brain in a robot body butts in, The advantage is all his, Sparrow,' but she is gone, locked in a dream booth.
You are about to greet your fellow agents at last when the globe screen flashes and your new section leader, Jobanque, seems to become flesh and blood before you. 'On-line, SAT Squad. Falcon, I need to see you right away. The rest I'll see straight afterwards. Where is Sparrowhawk?' You leave Lynx to explain as you run towards the pedway which will take you to your new leader.
The door to Jobanque's office slides open at your touch - the building's service computer recognises your handprint. Jobanque is standing before the holo-projector. He smiles and says, 'Well, I would apologise for asking you here on a Federation holiday but, in a way, it's your fault. I need you. I have a mission for you, Falcon. It may be every bit as perilous as your last.' You nod, then stare as a hologram of Yelov fills the room. The left side of his face is hidden by a silver mask and his left arm is that of a robot. Jobanque says gravely, 'When your blaster seared him he was damaged so badly that the medtechs had to use bionic parts to replace those you had destroyed. He is now half man, half robot. Now this thing (he is quite mad) has escaped from the Vault. Obviously, there can be no question that Yelov's claim that he was controlled by the Hivers is a lie.'
Jobanque's dark unmoving face stares at you. Until recently he had been Yelov's colleague, now you could almost believe he had hated him. 'There was a fault in the Psionic Damper which was grafted into his circuitry. He still has his formidable Powers of the Mind and he has used them to steal his old Time Machine. He has sworn vengeance on all Earthers, and on you, Falcon, in particular. There is no telling what damage he will do, his lust for absolute power is as great as ever. Agent Chameleon, returning from a routine patrol with a readout from the Timehole Monitoring Beacons on the current Timeholes, has reported a disturbance in the timeline of Mechanon, an enormous factory planet run entirely by droids, programmed only to mine metals, build copies of themselves and construct the most deadly arsenal of interstellar weaponry the universe had ever seen, until a terrible nuclear catastrophe reduced the planet to a tangled ruin of rock and metal. If Yelov is responsible and if he should find a way of reversing this accident, the entire galaxy would be held to ransom. You are our best agent Falcon, you must stop him before it is too late.'
You leave Jobanque's office at a run, bound for your Time Machine, Falcon's Wing, at the Eiger Vault. The other agents step aside to let you pass. Sparrowhawk is not with them. Turn to 1.

THE MISSION
1
[score a Q]
The hovrail car which will take you to the Eiger Vault glides soundlessly to a halt. As you secure the bubble hatch and type in your destination you are already considering the possibilities. The steady acceleration of the car lasts for half of the journey and as you begin to slow it dawns on you that this will be a difficult mission. Yelov Was a test pilot in the pioneering days of Time Travel; not only is he more experienced than anyone else, he also possesses the cat-like reflexes of the Siriuns. His skill in the Sim-Combat booths is legendary. Behind you the lights of Alpolis stretch for further than the eye can see even though the monorail arcs a thousand feet above the ground.
Less than an hour after leaving Jobanque's office you stand before the huge plasteel hangar doors of the Eiger Vault, set deep in the side of Mount Eiger. Your ID chip is checked and you are mind scanned before access to the vault is allowed by the service computer. As you pass the security droids, you reflect upon the folly of holding Yelov within this tight security net, instead of outside it. He is a million times more dangerous with a Time Machine at his disposal than if he were at large on Earth, 3033 AD. You cross the cavern which houses the Time Machines and the Research Section of TIME. The area in which the machines are kept is partitioned at intervals and you head straight for your own bay. In the centre of the bay, which is lined on three sides with racks carrying maintenance equipment, spare parts, the Variac Drive Recharger and sundry other useful items, lies Falcon's Wing, your Time Machine. You approach the access hatch and the Mind Scanner lights up red, then green. You are drawn up into the Time Machine by invisible Tractor Beams, activated by CAIN. Soon you are standing on the glowing Access Disc and CAIN chimes 'Welcome, Falcon.' Turn to 210.

2
As you open your mind to the alien you find yourself having to make a great effort to remain sane and regain your human sense of perspective. The Thrix live for millenia on a cold and lifeless world, barren of architecture - they have no need of building, and of almost everything else that you associate with civil- isation. You realise that something terrible is happening on this long-peaceful planet and that it wants you to accompany is towards a mining complex which is as alien to the Thrix as it is to you. The Thrix's name translates as Carborundum. Suddenly it lurches and begins to roll across the rocky ground. You decide to follow warily. Turn to 53.

3
Your aim, though hasty, is true and a sizzling beam of white-hot plasma erupts against the Black Knight. The black armour is ripped open, revealing mechanical gears and electronic circuitry beneath and the droid collapses before exploding loudly. Sir Thomas Chandos and the other knights turn towards you and then begin to run, terrified of your 'sorcery'. With a loud, if muffled, cheer the French knights press onward, scenting victory - your actions have changed the course of the battle and the English are losing. You quickly vapourise the remains of the droid as the tide of battle washes over you, defending yourself from the lances of the French with your shield. Will you:
Hasten back to Falcon's Wing? Turn to 216 Use your powers of Thinkstrike against
 the French knights?
Turn to 182

4
Your training has paid off. Faster even than the electronic circuitry of the wardroid, the lancing bolt of white hot energy hits its power plant and your helmet faceplate flash defence cuts in, darkening automatically as the bright explosion lights the yellow atmosphere, hurling debris everywhere. You have destroyed the wardroid that guards the loading bay but other robots may be on their way to intercept you. A rack of Polybdenum rods stands in the bay at the back of the cavernous armadillo-like mining droid. You seize your chance to destroy it. Turn to 141.

5
The edge of the refinery roof curves steeply down to the ground below, like the side of a bowl. You jump over the edge and slide down, skidding across the polished metal of another droid highway at the bottom. You run on across the featureless steel until part of the road seems to take off ahead of you. It is a flat-topped fortress droid which suddenly towers above you. Each of its sides boasts a formidable array of lasers and energy weapons, and hornlike sensors. Will you:

Open fire immediately?
Drop to the floor and turn the temperature control on your suit to freezing?
Turn to 35
Turn to 27

6
Your camera scans the gently rolling countryside of mediaeval northern France. Falcon's Wing stands on a hill overlooking a gentle slope on which stands the English army. Descending the hills opposite is the French army which seems about five times as large. It is mid afternoon, but the vanguard of the French army are advancing to the attack, led by six thousand or so mercenary troops, crossbowmen from Genoa, followed by double that number of mounted knights in full plate armour, the flower of chivalry, their shields and banners a glorious riot of colour. Behind these, and still trooping to the battlefield, are countless peasant infantry, some armed with pikes, but many making do with scythes roped to poles. The English army numbers a little over ten thousand men, composed of knights who have dismounted and will fight on foot, brave Welsh spearmen and a large number of longbowmen.
You decide to station yourself amongst the ranks of the English who are divided into three. Nearest to you are the reserves, and CAIN identifies the golden lions and fleur de lis of their leader, King Edward. Before these is another body of knights led by the King's young son, the Black Prince, who is surrounded by veteran knights, one of whom, Sir Thomas Chandos, bears a silver falcon on his red shield. A way to the left lies the third body of knights, lead by William de Bohun, Earl of Northampton, whose blue shield carries three red stars and six golden lions. The men of Northampton and the Black Prince are linked by a line of archers. Where will you position yourself?

The raildroid accelerates towards you and then swivels its weaponry in your direction. You open fire, but the bolt of superheated plasma is deflected in a flare of light by its shield. A grim ray streaks towards you. You hurl yourself aside. Make an Evasion Roll.

If you score 7-12, turn to 41
If you score 2-6, turn to 30

8
You set off towards them, but a phalanx of hovering wardroids pours out of the tunnel where you passed the raildroid. You destroy one but the barrage of their fire turns the communi- idtions area to molten slag and you do not survive it.

9
Since you have just spent an hour of your life in null-space you may restore up to twelve points of lost Endurance through the use of your Autodoc. As soon as you rematerialise in the Eiger Vault, CAIN memory banks are updated with any details of time-trips which may have been detected by the time beacons placed in each timehole.Someone has made another trip to the planet Thrix.

You open the doors and try to throw the android outside but it is enormously heavy and powerful. It picks you up in One hand and throws you against the wall with the force of a linear accelerator. You lose 9 Endurance points. A man suffering from an illness which affects his coordination staggers out of the urinal and advises you to wait and make your call later before tripping up over the back step of the recreation centre. The android continues to use the telephone but leans out and points a stunner at you. Make an Evasion Roll!

If you score 6-12, turn to 92
If you score 2-5, turn to 101


11
Three orange flares flicker on your screen, then die away to nothing. You have caused the missiles to pre-detonate before they reach you and you dive down into the thin atmosphere of Mechanon, using reverse thrust to slow the Strike Fighter down. Turn to 34.

12
Your sword blade whistles through air as the Black Knight reacts to your attack with superhuman speed. The visor on his great black helm clicks open. A beam of red light lances towards you and you try desperately to throw yourself aside. Make an Evasion Roll.

If you score 6-12, turn to 74
If you score 2-5, turn to 87

13
You rip your blaster from its holster and fire in a blur of fluid movement. The sizzling streak of white hot plasma turns the gas through which it lances red, as it plays across the face of the intelligent boulder. The Thrix is undamaged after a continuous ten-second burst when a large rock near your foot flies up towards your head. You try to jump aside, sluggish in the high gravity. Make an Evasion Roll.

You were not fast enough and the energy pulse picks you up a nd hurls you bodily against a rock outcropping. The plasnet of your suit repairs itself automatically, but the blast and the acid gas of Thrix's atmosphere which seeped into your suit have reducedyour Endurance by 10 points. If you are still alive, the contaminated wounds will heal poorly - subtract 1 from your maximum Endurance forever.

The Main Access portal is an oval opening, a hundred metres across and fifty tall. It seems to be composed of ten overlapping sections of metal which can slide open one at a time or all together. As you hurtle towards it a swarm of Atmospheric Interceptorsappear from the hangar opening. Their pulse lasers will soon be wreaking havoc on your ship's defences. Quickly you beam the Main Access Code at the Communication Tower above the portal and it slides open. You move from the gloomy brooding red of Mechanon's thin atmosphere to the ghostly green luminescence which lights an enormous tunnel that stretches ahead for miles. Ten Atmospheric Interceptors follow you down the tunnel, their pulse lasers winking on and off as they pour their deathly fire at your ship's defences. Turn to 109.

You fire your twin fusion cannons and two beams of energy leap from your wingtips, vapourising the incoming missile and flashingon to destroy the missile base, which simply ceases to exist. You bank further to the left and hurtle onward up the large tunnel. Turn to 28.

You make it to the doorway, but you haven't the electronic code to gain entry. The droid criss-crosses the highway with laser beamsand you cannot dodge them all. You are chopped into several pieces and your mission ends here.

The French knight topples forward, his lance ploughing a great furrow as he crashes to the ground like a sack of.coal. He lies still at your feet and his horse bucks and rears in panic before bolting. Will you:

You move deeper into the complex to radio your direction to Bloodhound and Lynx before switching on the homing signal in your environment suit. As you move along yet another vast tunnel the ceiling opens up and a hover platform descends towards you. You flatten yourself against the wall, but it carries only worker droids. As you watch they open a hatch in the tunnel wall and load a fifty-metre long starship Ion Drive onto the platform. The platform rises again and the ceiling is sealed once more. Lynx radios you to hold your position if at all possible. Three hovering wardroids and a raildroid appear at the far end of this tunnel and you are about to report that you must retreat when the ceiling opens once more. Bloodhound lowers a rope to you and they pull you up just as the green rays of a particle disrupter sheer into the luminous wall behind you. The raildroid aims again as you reach for the gap in the ceiling. Make an Evasion Roll as you try to scramble through to the planet surface.

They follow you to your Strike Fighter and it quickly becomes obvious that they believe your story. The hums of amazement grow and they are taking in every detail. After a time one of them, a physicist, says that he believes he could duplicate the Variac Drive. You push them away from it but it is too late. They wander off, ignoring you, but the Disputer says, 'Have no fear, we are not an aggressive race. With this Drive we can make sure than no disasters ever occur.' There is nothing that you can do now which will stop the Danikoi using Time Travel to mould history to their own decadent whims. Suddenly, everything goes dark. The Danikoi have changed history and it is as if you and the Space Federation had never existed.

22
Your lasers have sheared the drive away from one of the missiles and it spins harmlessly past you, in two pieces, but the other strikes home and explodes. The ship rocks and the gyros whir as it rights itself. Your hull armour or shields have saved, you from certain destruction but your ship has taken damage. subtract 1 from your Zeiss Shield energy if you are equipped with energy shields, or 2 Hull Armour points if your ship carries Titanium hull armour. Turn to 34.

The wardroid rises dramatically on its hover thrusters just as you fire. Your plasma blast ionises the gas in a long stream turning it from yellow to red, but it has passed beneath the wardroidwhich sweeps the area with a laser cannon. You are caught in the beam and sliced neatly into two at the waist. The shock kills you.

24
Your sword blade jars the Black Knight with a clang, and smoke and sparks fly up from its elbow joint. It staggers as if its circuits were overloading. It is certainly no man, but a droid, a mechanical man. It swivels its head towards you and the visor of Its great black helmet clicks open. You are ready when a beam of red light lances towards you from the droid's helmet and you dodge it and try to bury the tip of your sword into the gap left by the open visor. Make an Attack Roll.

You concentrate your mind and try to dominate the will of this sentient rock, but its mind is so alien you don't know where to begin. The Thrix is entirely unaffected but it seems to think that you have made a gesture of friendship and it opens its mind to you. Its name translates, in a shortened form, to Carborundum. It clicks at you and your translator tells you that it is beckoning you. Suddenly it lurches and begins to roll across the rocky ground. You decide to follow warily. Turn to 53.

As you step out of the recreation centre your Remote Access T erminal bleeps and CAIN sends you a message. The android is hooking into the telephone network and changing the informationreaching the Communist bloc defence computer which controls nearly half of the world's nuclear missiles at this time. You scale a wall and enter a courtyard in which there is a red and glass booth. The android is inside and you recognise an ancient 'tele'phone in its hand.

You hurtle through the air down the corridor. Below, you can see a large droid with a shield travelling on a rail running the length of the corridor. Within seconds you flash past it but moments later your microbeam radar picks up a high-energy leading ahead. A large mobile fortress lies in the corridor, an armoured disc bristling with weapon pods and sensor banks. It has two plasma cannon trained on you, several missile bases are tracking you and two energy beam gun turrets are swivelling around. The massive tunnel continues beyond it and another forks off the side. You have a few seconds in which to act. Will you:

The green ray expands as it stabs towards you and you are caught. The particles of your body coat the walls of the tunnel for fifty metres around in a thin film. You have fallen victim to a high intensity particle disruptor.

Your missile breaches a hole in the Main Access portal just large enough for you to fly through. You move from the gloomy, brooding red of Mechanon's thin atmosphere to the ghostly, green luminescent lights of an enormous tunnel which stretches ahead for miles. The Access portal opens suddenly and ten Atmospheric Interceptors follow you down the tunnel, their pulse lasers winking on and off as they pour their deadly fire into your ship's defences. You switch between fore and aft scanner but you have to leave your Battle, computer to target your aft lasers while you synchronise your evasion movements with its prediction of your movements.

The mind of this rock-being is so alien that you don't know where to begin with your assault on its will. The Thrix is entirely unaffected, but it seems to think that you have made a gesture of friendship and it touches your mind with its own. It clicks at you and your translator goes into operation. The Thrix is saying, 'It is a fact that you are not one of the killer types, but what did you mean by your flash of white fire?' Will you reply:

It was a gesture of greeting and friendship?

As you approach the Central Computer Complex, which glows a ghostly luminescent green, in the midst of the dull red expanse of metal, you enter a freak ion storm. CAIN tells you that the ion storm renders his detection scanners useless. If the same is true for the scanners fitted to the wardroids you may be able to fly right into the complex undetected, but you will have to rely on sight alone to navigate. You slow to Mach 4 and dive down into the storm. Just as you begin to pull out, fearing that you may hit the top of a cooling tower or energy pylon, you burst out of the storm. The polished metal of the launch field glints redly beneath and the warfleet has not yet been launched against Earth. You slow further and line yourself up for the hangar entrance into the glowing green Central Computer Complex. Turn to 257.

35
At this range you cannot miss the threatening mass of machinery. The beam of your blaster ignites particles in the air which pour upwards in a stream of fairy lights but the super- heated plasma has no effect on the heavily armoured droid. It criss-crosses the highway with laser beams and you cannot dodge them all. You are chopped into several pieces and your mission ends here.

36
With uncanny accuracy you thrust the sword through the open visor into the droid's computer brain. It folds up and then locks solid,its circuits dead. Looking around you realise that no-one has noticed that there is anything unusual about the droid knight and you drag it away, thankful that it is made of a light alloy.

You move back and an English knight looks at you and demands whether you will take the Frenchman prisoner so that you can ransom him. You shake your head saying, 'He's yours,' hoping the muffling effect of your helmet will explain the strange voice of your Universal Translator. The Frenchman's great helm has rolled away and he is recovering consciousness, but you can tell from his expression that he is suffering from concussion and probably will remember nothing. As he is bustled away you look about once more. The valiant French knights are charging time and time again, only to be repulsed by the fire of the English longbowmen. Turn to 162.

The beam of your particle disruptor flays Yelov's bionic arm until there is nothing left but smoke. His nerves react as though you had blown off his real arm again and he collapses to the floor.

Falcon's Wing rematerialises on Mechanon, which is a gleaming orb of polished metals. Robo-factories stretch as far as the eye can see, covering every inch of the planet's surface, almost without light in the sombre red sky. At three mile intervals around you are what must be planetary defence points: bronze domes bristling with some sort of surface-to-space artillery. Your scanners indicate that nothing lives on this dead world, not even grass, but it is alive with bizarrely-shaped droids which dart and scuttle across its face like insects. You decide to explore on foot and set out towards a building which glows a ghostly green. The bustling machines ignore you until you approach what looks like an enormous spaceship. The spacecraft suddenly disappears and you realise, horror-struck, that the droids of Mechanon have built an enormous Time Machine. You race back to Falcon's Wing but when you re-emerge in the Eiger Vault you are already too late. Wardroids are destroying everything and their Time Machine winks out to load up with reinforcements. The wardroids of Mechanon have invaded Earth in 3033 AD and there is nothing you can do to stop them conquering the world. The beam of a particle disruptor spreads you thinly across the shell of Falcon's Wing. You have failed.

The black Thrix tumbles onward through the yellow gases of its planet, glistening with condensation and reflective particles of dust. You pass the scattered remains of one of its species and you feel the hurt in the mind of the Thrix whom you are following, whose name translates as Carborundum. The grief of the loss of a two thousand-year friendship almost cripples you, but you steel yourself to hold on to your own identity, almost sobbing as you do so. The dead Thrix has been shorn in half by a terrible weapon. There are cavities within its crystal in which still smaller crystal trees grow. You communicate your surprise to Carborundum and he thinks his reaction to you. It seems that he finds your soft bendiness repulsive. 'You should see me without my suit,' you think. As you plod through the heavy gravity there is a slight movement in the heavy air and the fog lifts slightly to reveal the most enormous mechanical contraption, shaped like a long armadillo. Dust rises from its form and it rumbles slowly across the surface of the planet towards you on caterpillar tracks. Its body is composed of overlapping segments of metal like a woodlouse, which glow dully in the weak rays of the Thrixian sun, which barely penetrates the thick atmosphere. Thrix is cold.
Carborundum leads you down into a natural cavern which opens out below the gaping mouth of the mining droid. Two smaller excavation droids are clearing slag from a great conveyor belt which leads back into the belly of the armadillo- like droid. They do not react to you and you notice that their effectiveness is severely impaired by the corrosive gas of this world. They will soon break down completely. As you move towards the conveyor belt you notice another shattered Thrix nearby. Then a hovering wardroid with twin laser cannon sights you. Carborundum begins a high-pitched whining as you blast the wardroid to smithereens. You jump into the mining droid and Carborundum rolls up behind you. Inside the droid is a huge refining plant and in its belly you come to the central processor which controls it. Will you:

To your horror you realise that the Main Access is guarded by a reaction damping field. A small hole opens in one of the metal plates but it is too small for you to fly through. You pull up and roar skywards as the Atmospheric Interceptors swarm all around you. You try everything you know to shake them off, downing five of them at the same time, but in the end, weight of numbers tells. Your ship's defences are destroyed and a pulsing laser beam causes your Strike Fighter to explode. You are consumed with it in a ball of orange flame. You have failed.

You bank towards the mountainous space bomb and open fire with your fusion beams. They seem to have little or no effect, but a door opens on its back and a swarm of fighters, nimble and fast, pours out. Will you:

The excess of adrenaline pumping through your body is causing your arm to shake. You have missed and the droid has relocated you. It criss-crosses the highway with laser beams and you cannot dodge them all. You are chopped into several pieces and your mission ends here.

Your camera scans the gently rolling countryside of mediaeval northern France. Falcon's Wing stands on a hill overlooking a gentle slope on which stands the English army. Descending the hills opposite is the French Army, which seems about five times as large. It is mid afternoon, but the vanguard of the French army are advancing to the attack, led by six thousand or so mercenary troops, crossbowmen from Genoa, followed by double that number of mounted knights in full plate armour, the flower of chivalry, their shields and banners a glorious riot of colour. Behind these, and still trooping to the battlefield, are countless peasant infantry, some armed with pikes, but many making do with scythes roped to poles. The English army numbers a little over ten thousand men, composed of knights who have dismounted and will fight on foot, brave Welsh spearmen and a large number of longbowmen.
CAIN tells you that if history is unchanged, the quick fire of the English bowmen will be the weapon that wins total victory. If the French were to win the battle CAIN cannot compute a likely outcome but Edward HI, King of England, might be deposed and the Hundred Y ears W ar might never be. France would probably grow much stronger than England or Spain. You decide to station yourself amongst the ranks of the English who are divided into three. Nearest to you are the reserves, and CAIN identifies the golden lions and fleur de lis of their leader, King Edward. Before these is another body of knights led by the young King's son, the Black Prince, who is surrounded by veteran knights, one of whom, Sir Thomas Chandos, bears a silver falcon on his red shield. A way to the left lies the third body of knights, lead by William de Bohun, Earl of Northampton, whose blue shield carries three red stars and six golden lions. The men of Northampton and the Black Prince are linked by a line of archers. Where will you position yourself?

You regain the safety of Falcon's Wing, suffering no more than the mockery of some camp followers who think that you are fleeing the battle in fear. CAIN tells you that his scanners registered the fact that the Black Knight was a droid from Mechanon, and that it must have been programmed to kill Sir Thomas Chandos who is probably your ancestor. 'Be careful, Falcon, Yelov is trying to kill you.' If you didn't know that electronic brains are not programmed to register emotion CAIN's tone would have you believe he was worried on your behalf. You can see on the console screen that the battle is continuing. The Black Prince is alive, another horse between his knees, and his standard has been raised once more. The camera roomsin on the leader of yet another French charge. CAIN tells you t h a t the man in the visor-less helmet tied to two other knights who are leading his horse into battle is King John the Blind of Bohemia. Once again the French charge is broken by the English archers and is thrown back. You can see the blind king lying dead on the field, still tied to his brave knights.

You dive for the shelter of the rock outcropping but you have misjudged the strength needed to do so in the high gravity of Thrix. You smash into the ground as the missile reaches you. It carries an armour piercing warhead which drills a river of boiling copper through you as it detonates. You have failed.

You tell them that you have useful information to be analysed at the Eiger Vault and agree to leave Mechanon before you are all destroyed. The Time Machines of Bloodhound and Lynx are not far from Falcon's Wing; you make your way back at a run. Your combined firepower is enough to dispose of the two wardroids which cross your path, but Bloodhound is wounded when you are 'buzzed' by three strafing Atmospheric Interceptors.

Yelov leaps aside and takes cover behind a bank of electronic machinery. You step towards it but the computer opens a hatchway beneath your feet and you fall through it. You blast with your jetpack but the hatchway closes, trapping you at the neck.

You hurl yourself to the ground, a lancing fed light narrowly missing your shoulder.

Waiting until you are far enough away from Falcon's Wing to avoid causing exhaust damage, you cut in the Flyer's Ion Drive and accelerate to Mach 3. You curve in a gentle arc towards the fluorescent building and as you pass out from behind a huge iron cooling tower an incredible sight meets your gaze. A spaceship almost as large as one of the generation starships of the 24th century is being dismantled on a huge brass landing field. As you fly over it you see a contraption which can only be an enlarged variac drive being hoisted out of its front end. It takes a few seconds for you to realise what has been happening. The factory droids must have manufactured this colossal Time Machine in hours! Hundreds of them hover about it. They must have planned to invade the Eiger Vault with this machine on Earth, 3033 AD. Now that you have destroyed the Polybdenum and the Timehole on Thrix has closed, Yelov must have altered his plans. As you streak onwards a daunting vista opens up beneath you. It is Mechanon's space launch field, and it is packed with an interstellar warfleet the size of which defies belief. Row upon row of Interceptors, Ion-drive Battle Cruisers and Atmospheric Fighter-carrying mother-ships glow a burnished bronze beneath the dull red sky. Turn to 133.

76
You have misjudged the range and failed to cause the missiles to explode before hitting you and they are closing fast. You slam the Strike Fighter into an arcing power drive towards one of the huge iron cooling towers and pull up at the last moment, thankful for the discovery of G-force dampers. One of the missiles hits the cooling tower, which rings in the thin atmosphere like the toll of a high-pitched bell. The other missile slams into you and causes 1 point of damage to your Energy Shields or 2 points of damage to your Titanium Hull Armour, but your Strike
Fighter is still functional. You decide to retaliate. Will you fire a missile:

At the Planetary Defence Base?
At the fortress droid that hovers before the Central Computer Complex?

The Thrix seems unperturbed by the knowledge that you tried to harm it. Apparently it can withstand the most extreme temperatures and ionic disturbances. It tells you that a mining complex has recently appeared on the planet, a complex as alien to it as you are, and it offers to lead you to it. You decide to follow warily when, out of the gloom, a red light appears ahead of you. A great metal monster comes towards you out of the fog. It has four hover-thruster discs, and it is heavily armoured. It is equipped with an awesome array of weaponry - an Ion Beam discharge, mortar cluster, laser cannon mountings, high explosive machine rifles and the like. It is aiming a laser cannon at you - you have no choice but to blast it. The superheated plasma fuses its metal shell and it explodes with a roar, before it can fire. The Thrix registers pleasure at your action and you continue through the fog together. Turn to 53.

79
You turn the superheated plasma beam of your blaster on the immobile wardroid, an easy target. The lancing bolt of white- hot energy hits its power plant and the flash defence on your helmet automatically cuts in and the faceplate darkens as the lurid explosion lights the yellow atmosphere, hurling debris everywhere. The second wardroid unleashes a guided missile which is homing in on the heat of your body. All you can do is dive behind a rock outcropping and hope that it doesn't carry a fissionwarhead.

You tell them that you have useful information to be analysed at the Eiger Vault and agree to leave Mechanon before you are all killed. They tell you that Falcon's Wing has been destroyed and you are forced to ask for passage back to the Vault. You make your way back to their machines at a run and your combined firepower is enough to dispose of the four wardroids which attack, but Bloodhound is wounded when you are 'buzzed' by three strafing Atmospheric Interceptors. Lynx is glad to allow you the use of her autodoc and you take a relaxant and recuperate. You may restore up to 12 points of lost Endurance. Turn to 102.

You press the launch button and the launch doors fly apart as you are hurtled out of Falcon's Wing. Waiting until you are far enough away from Falcon's Wing to avoid causing exhaust damage, you cut in the Flyer's Ion Drive and accelerate to Mach 3. The Flyer's instruments indicate that your Ion Drive's exhaust is being tracked and the radar shows three ballistic missiles speeding towards your Time Machine. You avoid them with ease, but two of them score direct hits on Falcon's Wing and a third destroys the mining droid behind it. The Flyer has rocked by the blast. When the cloud of pulverised dust has settled nothing remains of Falcon's Wing. You are trapped time and space on the soul-less factory world of Mechanon with only two days' supply of recyclable oxygen in your Flyer.
Your radar screen picks up another salvo of incoming missiles. You flick the joystick left and backwards but the missiles are: homing in on you. Only a sharp turn at the moment before impact will save you. Make an Evasion Roll but count your Evasion Modifier as zero.

As soon as you arrive back in the Eiger Vault CAIN tells you that Jobanqueis waiting in the research section to debrief you. With Bloodhound and Lynx, you walk briskly to meet him. He is in the office of the head of the research section of TIME, Skirrow, the man who, in his younger days as a space rover, discovered Planet Hel and Skirrow's World. He is a stocky man with red gold hair and he welcomes you cordially. You make a full report to Jobanque who nods pensively throughout. Skirrow takes your universal Interface to unscramble the information it now holds. By the time you have finished telling your story of the horrors of Mechanon, a story which Lynx and Bloodhound confirm, Skirrow has returned with a holo-readout. He confers with Jobanque and they swiftly reach agreement as to the next course of action. Skirrow tells you that you have successfully tapped the data-banks of the Command Computer on Mechanon. 'It is named after Zordekai, the Danikoi who designed it. It seems that, since you have stopped Yelov and the wardroids moving through time to attack the Space Federation in 3033 AD, they are planning to attack Earth, using starship droids, in 1986 AD.'
Jobanque says, 'You, and you alone, must stop them before they take off, Falcon. Skirrow will explain why you must go on without support.' You follow Skirrow to the top secret research laboratory, which is in total darkness.

You whip out your blaster and fire with the consummate skill of one who has scored MAX in the sim-combat booths three times running. The telephone booth and the android erupt in a small explosion but a piece of twisted metal crashes against your helmet so hard that you fall stunned. Lose 3 Endurancepoints. If you are still alive, you regain your senses to the sound of a siren, like that of an Enforcer's jetcopter nearby, and two men in navy blue uniforms run towards you from the recreation centre.

It is equipped with an awesome array of weaponry - an Ion Beam discharge, mortar cluster, laser cannon mountings, high explosive machine rifles and the like. It is aiming a laser cannon at you - you have no choice but to blast it. The superheated plasma fuses its metal shell and it explodes with a roar, before it can fire. The Thrix tumbles away across the rocky ground at a speed which you cannot hope to match - evidently it has realised what you meant by 'a gesture of friendship'! Turn to 395.

96
You have misjudged the manoeuvre and your wing tip catches a rail which runs the length of the tunnel. The Strike Fighter rights itself but the missile hits you and your wing snaps off. You hurtle on down the tunnel towards the base of a cooling tower which stretches far above the ceiling into the atmosphere Unable to avoid it you crash sickeningly and the Strike Fighter erupts into roaring flames. You are burnt to a crisp.

97
The droid brakes to a stop in an instant. You have only gone a few metres when you are hit by its green ray, which expands as it stabs towards you. The particles of your body coat the walls of the tunnel for fifty metres around in a thin film. You have fallen victim to a high intensity particle disruptor.

98
The questing beam of the wardroid's laser cannon brushes your side, shaving an inch of flesh and bone off your leg and hip. The plasnet of your ruptured suit repairs itself but the awful wound is contaminated by the acid gas of Thrix. Lose 11 Endurance points. If you are still alive, the wound will heal badly - remove 1 from your maximum Endurance scon forever. You return fire at the immobile death machine. The lancing bolt of white hot energy hits its power plant and your helmet faceplate flash defence cuts in, darkening automatically as the bright explosion lights the yellow atmosphere, hurling debris everywhere. You have destroyed both of the wardroids that guard the loading bay but other robots may be on their way to intercept you. Turn to 120.

You hurl yourself to the ground, the lancing red light narrowly missing your shoulder. As you pick yourself up the Black Knight swivels and raises his mace to strike at Sir Thomas Chandos who himself is engaged in a titanic struggle with the Duke of Alencon and another French knight.

The G-force dampers work overtime as the Flyer slews drunkenly away from the missiles and you correct its flight path just before impact with the side of a huge iron cooling tower. The missiles slam into the cooling tower, demolishing it completely. Asyoushootpastittowardsthebuildingintowhich the droid flew, an incredible sight meets your gaze.

Before you have time to fire your blaster the android fires again and you fall stunned to the ground. When you come round the android is standing motionless outside the booth, deactivated. Sirens like those of an Enforcer's jetcopter sound far away in the night as orange streaks roar overhead. There is a flash of light and a thunderous roar as a great mushroom cloud of incandescent flame and smoke erupts into the upper atmos- phere. The next explosion turns your eyes to steam and strips you to a charred skeleton. The android has somehow provoked a nuclear holocaust on earth. Yelov has won.

He is in the office of the head of the research section of TIME, Skirrow, the man who, in his younger days as a space rover, discovered Planet Hel and Skirrow's World. He is a stocky man with red gold hair and he welcomes you cordially. You make a full report to Jobanque who nods pensively throughout. Then he looks you in the eye and asks you if you appreciate that CAIN alone COM more than the medical welfare of twenty million people. You reply that of course you appreciate the cost, but that there was little time in which to think. 'Very well, let's see what information you have brought back at such cost,' says Jobanque brusquely. Skirrow takes your Universal Interface to un scramble the information it now holds. By the time you have finished telling your story of the horrors of Mechanon, a story which Lynx and Bloodhound confirm, Skirrow has returned with a holo-readout.

Condensation trails from the Strike Fighter's wing tips as you dive at Mach 5 into the thin atmosphere of Mechanon, towards the Central Computer Complex which glows a ghostly luminescent green. As you turn on reverse thrust and decelerate towards the huge hangar opening you notice a mobile fortress droid hovering upwards ahead of you, and a Planetary Defence Base beyond a huge iron cooling tower to your left. The fortress droid is a huge disc, bristling with missile lasers and plasma cannon space artillery. The Planetary Defence Base is a cluster of several missile launchers and radar dishes. The Battle computer reports an Atmospheric Interceptor closing up behind you at Mach 5.7, as two missiles streak towards you from the Defence Base.

You re-materialise high above a green world circled with bands of white cloud. You guide your Strike Fighter towards the largest city that you can see as you skim the rolling hills and plains of Danikos. CAIN says you have been detected but your radar, although covered in moving blips, does not show any aircraft moving to intercept you. You finally set your Fighter down in a sandy square. All of the buildings that you have seen so far look like the palaces of times still to come on Earth. Each is overburdened with exquisitely complicated carvings and orna- mental turrets and domes. A small crowd gathers - the Danikoi are spindly, tall humanoids with sparkling eyes of gold, without iris or pupil. They have no body hair. There are no weapons in sight and you blow the hatch seal and step out. You approach the crowd who show no fear despite your formidable array of weaponry and the outlandish whine of your power suit. Your translator synthesises your speech as a metallic humming when you ask to be taken to their decision makers. There is a ripple of humming laughter and one of them invites you to a party instead, but eventually you manage to convince them to do as you ask. Turn to 222.

Your blaster discharges a crackling beam of superheated plasma at the breastplate of the French knight. A great hole is burnt in his chest and he topples dead from his horse. The immediate dangeris over, but as you hide the weapon once more a strange change overcomes you. You are lucky, no-one has noticed the energy beam of your blaster, thinking it was no more than the gleamof the sun's rays off the polished metal of armour, but your breathing seems to falter and you feel weak. Your memories change. Whereas once you remembered as a child being successfully cured of a disease caused by a mutant virus, your memory now tells you that a different medtech used an inferior treatment to cure you. With a shock you realise you have just killed the ancestor of the man who would have invented the cure. He will never have existed. You lose 3 Endurancepoints and your total Endurance may now never exceed 17. You recover from the shock quickly and notice that the valiant French knights are charging time and time again only to be repulsed by the fire of the English longbowmen. Turn to 162.

107
You pass the central processor which is cocooned in a web of soft polystyrene and cooled by a steady flow of near-freezing air.Beyond it is the whir and clank of machinery, and the heat of a small furnace. It is an ore refining plant and the Polybdenum ore is being fed in at one end and the lumps of reddish rock emerge at the other in the form of sleek rods usable in the Variac Drive of Time Machines. Beyond the refinery is the back end of the armadillo-like mining droid where a conveyor belt moves the rods onto a plasteel rack. Beyond the rack hover two guardian wardroids. A sensor in the mining droid alerts them to your presence and they swoop towards you. The lancing white- hot beam of your blaster ionises the yellow gas, turning it red on its path towards one of the wardroids. You score a direct hit on its power plant and your helmet faceplate turns dark as the lurid explosion lights the interior of the mining droid and debris is hurled through the churning yellow gas of the atmosphere. Carborundum lurches forward, crashing into the second droid, smashing its hover pads and immobilising it. As the wardroid crashes to the ground you see that it is aiming a missile which points at the Thrix. Your blaster cuts a path to destruction once more, fusing the metal casing of the droid until it begins to melt, collapsing in on itself. Turn to 181.

108
You rise up using your suit jets but Yelov slices the great girder through the air like the arm of a windmill and it crashes into your back, destroying your jetpack. You fall to the ground and surge to your feet once more but Yelov's plasma pistol spits energy at you once again. Turn to 161.

109
You dive down a tunnel which opens up on your left, hoping that the interceptor droids will not be able to make the same manoeuvre at such speed. The gyro stabilisers whine as you use every ounce of performance the Strike Fighter has. The tunnel curves to the left and you bank and turn in an arc. When it straightens out you can see the mouth of the hangar from the inside, now some miles ahead of you. The droid repair shot's loom towards you and they are protected by a missile launcher which is directed away from you at the hangar. It must be the one that launched the missile the size of your Fighter out of the hangar at you. It is rearmed. The interceptors have lost little time, screaming along behind you as you hurtle over the missile launcher. Your radar tells you that it has launched another missile which is close behind. Will you:

Use electronic counter measures?
Use your aft lasers to deal with it?

You evade the questing beam of the wardroid's laser cannon and return fire at the death machine.

You have destroyed both of the wardroids that guard the loading bay, but other robots may be on their way to intercept you. Turn to 120.

111
The Duke of Alencon is brave, impetuous and headstrong. Your efforts to subjugate his will are not enough, he merely swings his sword at you. You step back, but as you do so the Black Knight's mace buries itself in Sir Thomas Chandos' helmeted head, splitting it like an overripe melon. You reach for your blaster but everything goes black. Yelov's assassin droid has killed Sir Thomas Chandos, your ancestor, before his son has been born. His line has died and so have you, along with it. It is as if you had never existed.

112
The G-force dampers on your Flyer work overtime as it slews drunkenly out of the path of the missiles. The gyros whine, but one of the missiles passes close enough to you for its computer to decide to detonate. Your Ion Drive is destroyed and you plummet towards the surface of Mechanon. The flyer breaks up on contact but you are flung free, skidding and tumbling for two hundred yards down a polished metal droid highway. Your suit cushions you from the worst but you have lost 6 Endurance points as well as your Flyer. You can only limp onward towards the strange building. Turn to 5.

The tip of the French knight's lance catches your shield near the top, causing it to tip backwards. The lance rides up over the shield and bores into your chest, tearing through the chain mail corselet, as if it were paper. Lose 8 Endurance points as you are thrown to the ground by the momentum of his charge. You stagger to your feet, thankful that the armour CAIN prepared for you is lighter than the real thing, as the knight throws down his lance and, reining in, draws his blade, intent on finishing you.

The central processor is cocooned in a web of soft polystyrene and cooled by a steady flow of near-freezing air. You play your blaster's beam across the free-floating oil-discs which you guess control the working memory of the mining droid's electronic brain. The mining operation shuts down immediately. You carry on past the processor into another cavernous space lit dimly by the light of a furnace. It is a refining plant and the Polybdenum ore is being fed in at one end and the lumps of reddish rock emerge at the other in the form of sleek rods, usable in the Variac Drive of a Time Machine. Beyond the refinery is the back end of the armadillo-like mining droid, where a conveyor belt moves the rods onto a plasteel rack. Swooping towards you up the ramp at the back are two wardroids. Carborundum lurches forward, colliding with one. The twenty tons of rock which is the Thrix severely dents the droid. It stops and sinks to the ground but is about to launch a missile at Carborundum.

One of the technicians floods the hangar with light and the most advanced piece of weaponry ever designed by the Space Federation is revealed in all its glory. Forty metres long, it looks like a highly advanced, oversized Atmospheric Interceptor. It has four wings which sweep back to needle points on either side of a huge ion-plasma drive tube. A drive like that must mean interstellar capability and the ship is fitted with hyper-drive Skirrow explains, This is a Weeks/Senior Corporation Space Navy Strike Fighter; She has a Variac Drive fitted; this is the first time travel starship, Falcon, treat her well. A copy of CAIN's memory has been installed and linked into our most advanced Battle computer. You have a choice between Zeiss deflector shields or Titanium hull armour.' Skirrow enters the Strike Fighter and explains the controls and capabilities of the craft. She has electronic counter measures, a Variac Drive, four guided missiles with fission warheads, radar and sonic dampers, twin fusion cannons on the upper wing tips, re-entry shields and aft 'point defence' beam lasers. Skirrow continues, 'We have: tailored a Startrooper battlesuit to your size, Falcon. It has a built-in particle disruptor, psionic enhancer helmet, face-up radar display, energy rocket launcher and power armour, which will give you the strength of an android, and boost-jets. The ship handles just like an ordinary Atmospheric Interceptor. Good luck.'
You stare mesmerised at the controls. 'It's all colour coded,' says Skirrow. 'You're not colour-blind, are you ?' You laugh. The only reason Skirrow is not head of the Special Agent Section is that the medtechs failed him because of red/green colour-blindness.
Jobanque says, 'She's all yours, Falcon. Use her to destroy the CentralComputer on Mechanon before the war-fleet blasts off. Our information is that the Central Command Computer can be found within the section you penetrated earlier, but deeper within. It will take us several hours to complete tests on the V ariac Drive. We can fit her with Zeiss deflector shields instead of her armour, or leave the Titanium hull in place. It's your decision.' You make your decision.

The Danikoi have changed history and it is as if you and the Space Federation had never existed.

The Duke of Alencon comes under your control and his sword sweeps in a great arc towards the Black Knight even as the mace begins to fall on Sir Thomas Chandos. Alencon's sword strikes first and the Black Knight jerks unnaturally, his mace blow shaving Chandos' armour. Sparks fly from his armour as he keels over and his helmet visor clicks open." A beam of red light springs from the open helm and Alencon's armour begins to boil, frying him alive. The light plays on three English men at arms who suffer the same horrible death before your blaster vapourises the robot knight. These strange happenings are too much even for the flower of English chivalry who begin to run. The French knights scent victory and a great roar, muffled by their helmets, swells from the French ranks. You have changed history and the tide of battle is going against the English. Will you:

The side of the refinery slopes smoothly to a polished metal droid highway below, like the edge of a bowl. You step over the edge and slide down shooting across the highway at the bottom as if you were on ice. A few worker droids which are using the highway ignore you completely. After about half an hour you emerge from behind a huge iron cooling tower, towards the fluorescent building. You see a large wardroid hovering ahead and duck into a passageway between two large dome-like structures sporting revolving sensor dishes pointed at the stars. You continue along it, skirting the wardroid. When you emerge, you see a massive flat-topped tower ahead. A dark shape appears in the sky and a heavy Interplanetary cargo droid sinks slowly onto the top of the tower, its retros roaring. Your helmet radio picks up a recognition signal from the cargo droid to the tower and you switch your transmitter to record. The cargo droid beams another message to the tower.
There is a deep rumbling sound and the droid is drawn into the tower - its roof is an Access Pad. You transmit the Main Access, Code to CAIN in Falcon's Wing. Note down the number 15 and that you have the Main Access Code. You will be told when you can turn to 15. You turn away and head towards the hangar-like entrance of the fluorescent building. The rim of the hangar boasts twenty great space-artillery pieces like outward pointing teeth in the cavernous maw of a prehistoric monster. As you approach it, skirting a huge iron cooling tower, an incredible sight meets your gaze. A spaceship almost as large as one of the generation starshipsof the 24th century is being dismantled on a huge brass landing field. As you fly over it you see a contraption which can only be an enlarged Variac Drive being hoisted out of its front end. It takes a few seconds for you to realise what has been happening. The factory droids must have manufactured this colossal Time Machine in hours! Hundreds of them hover about it. They must have planned to invade the Eiger Vault with this machine on Earth, 3033 AD. Now that you have destroyed the Polybdenum and the Timehole on Thrix has closed, Yelov must have altered his plans. As you go onwards, a daunting vista lies ahead. It is Mechanon's space launch field, and it is packed with an interstellar warfleet the size of which defies belief. Row upon row of Interceptors, Ion-drive Battle Cruisers and Atmos- pheric Fighter-carrying Mother-ships glow a burnished bronze beneath the dull red sky. Turn to 234.

The Battle computer locks on and you press the red button which launches a missile at the Planetary Defence Base. Seconds before your missile destroys it, the fortress droid opens fire with a plasma cannon. A glowing white shell streaks towards you and you slam your Strike Fighter into another tight turn, hoping to avoid it. Make an Evasion Roll.

Your expertise with the sword is by no means as great as with your blaster and the sword rings harmlessly off the black helmet. The droid's response is far quicker than any man's as it brings the crackling mace down upon you with a crash and a squeal of tearing armour. Lose 12 Endurance points. You stagger but steel yourself to go on, just as the visor on the Black Knight's helm clicks open and a beam of red light lances towards you. Turn to 99.

You make it over the wall but as you set off down the tarmac strip towards your Strike Fighter you are blinded by the sudden flare of the searchlights of a machine called a car for a moment before your flash dampers cut in. Two more men in blue uniforms get out and one of them manages to hurl himself at you so that you lose your footing and fall to the ground. He is on top of you and you decide to use your Power of Will. Make a Power of Will Roll.

He is hard pressed from all sides and the great swipe of your sword catches him in the neck, piercing and denting his armour. He falls, stricken, to the grass and breathes no more. As you pull your sword from the dented metal a strange change overcomes you. Your breathing seems to falter and you feel weak. Your memories change. Whereas once you remembered as a child being successfully cured of a disease caused by a mutant virus your memory now tells you that a different medtech used an inferior treatment to cure you. With a shock you realise you have just killed the ancestor of the man who would have invented the cure. He will never have existed. You lose 3 Endurance points and your total Endurance may now never exceed 17. You recover from the shock quickly and notice that the valiant French knights are charging time and time again, only to be repulsed by the fire of the English longbowmen. Turn to 162.

You roll behind the furnace.and open fire at the wardroid which threatens the Thrix. You blast just in time, hitting the power plant of the wardroid. Your faceplate reacts instantly, cutting in the flash damper, and it darkens as a bright explosion lights up the interior of the machinery of the refining plant. The second droid shoots across the refinery bay to bring its laser cannon to hear against you. You try to dive under the massive conveyor belt, hoping that it is dense enough to stop the laser.

One of the technicians floods the hangar with light and the most advanced piece of weaponry ever designed by the Space Federation is revealed in all its glory. Forty metres long, it looks like a highly advanced, oversized Atmospheric Interceptor, It has four wings which sweep back to needle points on either side of a huge ion-plasma drive tube. A drive like that must mean interstellar capability and the ship is fitted with hyper-drive. Skirrow explains, 'This is a Weeks/Senior Corporation Space Navy Strike Fighter. She has a Variac Drive fitted; this is the first time travel starship, Falcon, treat her well. A copy of CAIN's memory has been installed and linked into our most advanced Battle computer. She has Titanium hull armour.' Skirrow enters the Strike fighter and explains the controls and capabilities of the craft. She has electronic counter measures, a Variac Drive, four guided missiles with fission warheads, radar and sonic dampers, twin fusion cannons on the upper wing tips, re-entry shields and aft 'point defence' beam lasers. Skirrow continues, 'We have tailored a Startrooper battlesuit to your size, Falcon. It has a built-in particle disruptor, psionic enhancer helmet, face-up radar display, energy rocket launcher and power armour, which will give you the strength of an android, and boost-jets. The ship handles just like an ordinary Atmospheric Interceptor. Good luck.'
You stare mesmerised at the controls. 'It's all colour coded/says Skirrow. 'You're not colour-blind, are you ?' You laugh. The only reason Skirrow is not head of the Special Agent Section is that the medtechs failed him because of red/green colour-blindness.
Jobanque says, 'It will take us several hours to complete tests on the Variac Drive, then she's all yours, Falcon. Use her to destroy the Central Computer on Mechanon before the war-fleet blasts off. Our information is that the Central Command Computer can be found within the section you penetrated earlier, but deeper within. Turn to 143.

You are about to make your way back to Falcon's Wing when a machine shaped like a flying beetle appears in the yellow mist before you. A red light shines on its belly and a form glides to the ground on a disc of metal. With a shock you realise that it is a huge Time Machine and the form is that of the arch villain, Agidy Yelov. A field of orange energy crackles around him; it seems he has stolen the force-field technology of the Creche. He is able to stand unprotected on Thrix, inside the defensive shield. Seeing you and the destroyed Polybdenum he screams with rage. The half of his face which you can see twists in a spasm and his robot arm twitches. In the wisps of yellow fog he looks like a foul demon from the blackest hell. He shouts, 'I thought I had erased you from existence at the battle of Crecy, Falcon. You've meddled with my plans once again, but you cannot stop me this time, I have the most deadly arsenal the universe will ever know ready to obey my every command. I shall re-program every droid, Falcon, so that your death, which is imminent, will be as slow and painful as the technology of Mechanon can devise.' Just then two wardroids appear above the mining complex and as you look up Yelov draws his blaster. You try desperately to get behind the scarred plasteel loading rack before he kills you, but Yelov is very fast and a superb marksman. Make an Evasion Roll.

The Duke of Alencon comes under your control and his sword sweeps in a great arc towards the Black Knight even as the mace begins to fall on Sir Thomas Chandos. Alencon's sword strikes first and the Black Knight jerks unnaturally, his mace blow shaving Chandos' armour. Sparks fly from the Black Knight's armour as he keels over and his helmet visor clicks open. A beam of red light springs from the open helm and Alencon's armour begins to boil, frying him alive. The light plays on three English men at arms who suffer the same horrible death before your blaster vapourises the robot knight. These strange happenings are too much even for the flower of English chivalry who begin to run. The French knights scent victory and a great roar, muffled by their helmets, swells from the French ranks. You have changed history and the tide of battle is going against the English. Will you:

As you head towards the hangar-like opening in the building behind the dismantled Time Machine, your radar picks up ten fast-moving objects closing quickly. As you begin to decelerate before entering the building, ten Atmospheric Interceptors dive on you. They are automatic flying droids, somewhat larger than and as fast as your Flyer.

Your missile streaks to its target and detonates with a roar. The fortress droid rocks and then plummets down onto the roof of a refinery in a sea of sparks. The fuel inside catches light and there is an enormous explosion and a torrent of flaming fuel flows down one of the droid highways, throwing huge dancing shadows amongst the metal monoliths of this world of factories. The Atmospheric Interceptor is closing in on your tail. You must switch to your rear view scanner and try to pick it off with your point defence lasers, a difficult task as the Interceptor goes into auto-evade, weaving and climbing erratically.

The console screen in front of you lights up as CAIN presents a short history of the planet Mechanon.

# File-Mech 01
Time 03.14
MECHANON:	Fourth planet orbiting Silurus Six
DIAMETER:	9,200 miles
ATMOSPHERE:	Main constituents, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Argon, Helium and Xenon
GRAVITY:	1.356 Earth standard
COMPOSITION:	Rich in mineral ores, metals and trace elements
SURFACE TEMPERATURE:	43C-59C
LENGTH OF DAY:	31 hours Earth standard time

First landing by sentient species:	19067 BC
First colonists:	The Danikoi

The Danikoi, a highly intelligent humanoid race, were the first known space travellers. Their civilisation crumbled millenia ago but a small group of Danikoi, realising that their race was doomed, decided to leave a lasting monument to their society.' They built robots which could build and program more robots made from the materials mined on the metal rich world of Mechanon. Mechanon became a single immense factory which l.\sted long beyond the last visit of a Danikoi spaceship. Unfortunately, the Danikoi had caused the original robots to be programmed to take whatever steps were necessary to ensure that Mechanon remained a lasting testament to the glory of Danikoi technology. The robots of Mechanon sought to assemble space weapons with which they could wipe out all intelligent life, throughout the universe, for there was no other way for them to ensure that Mechanon remained forever.
In 2291 AD, prior to the launch of the roboships, a nuclear disaster reduced the planet to a featureless mass of fused metal and rock. None of the wardroids of Mechanon remained functional.

The rack contains nearly a hundred rods of Polybdenum. The mining droid which rumbles along at less than a half a mile an hour pulls the rack along behind it. The ore is fed onto the rack by a conveyor belt and is already refined into rods for the use of a Variac Drive by the refining plant in the belly of the cavernous armadillo-like droid. You play your blaster across the rods and they glow red and begin to react with the chlorine in the Thrixian atmosphere, becoming a useless crumbling compound.
Turn to 131.

142
The wardroids of Mechanon have built an enormous time travel ship using Polybdenum from Thrix. Suddenly it appears in the Eiger Vault, and countless Wardroids pour out of it. The ship winks out once more, to pick up reinforcements. There are already four hundred of them, Interceptors, missile platforms and hovering fortresses and there is nothing you can do to stop them conquering the world, as the beam of a particle disruptor spreads you thinly across the shell of Falcon's Wing. You have failed.

Jobanque tells you to rest until the Weeks/Senior Corporation Strike Fighter is ready. You decide to take the hovrail to the leisure park. Alpolis hums with activity, news of Yelov's escape has been suppressed to avoid mass hysteria. You stroll leisurely towards the old style iron gates of the leisure park with its live sheep.

You blast just in time, hitting the power plant of the wardroid. Your faceplate reacts instantly, cutting in the flash damper, and it darkens as a bright explosion lights up the interior of the machinery of the refining plant. Carborundum is not so lucky. The armour-piercing missile shatters his rocky shell, pouring molten copper into his sound chambers which then explode. A terrible keening fills the air as the Thrix dies and the sonic vibrations crack your faceplate. The acid gas of the Thrixian atmosphere invades your suit and you die horribly as it dissolves your eyes and face. You have failed.

You hurtle downwards, at a 90 degree angle to the ground, trying to pass between the two flaring balls of plasma, but you have misjudged it and one of them slams into your forward hull, engulfing your ship in boiling plasma. Lose 2 Shield defence points or 1 Armour point. If your ship's defences have fallen below zero turn to 90. If you have survived, the ship bucks wildly but the gyros, whining shrilly, manage to right it. The plasma dissipates. You engage the booster thruster and surge forward over the fortress, but a missile launcher has been tracking you and three sleek and deadly dart-shaped missiles fly from the launchers.

Your evasion manoeuvres are breathtaking and successful, the Atmospheric Interceptors scream overhead, the red pencil- beams of their lasers darting all about you. As you decelerate towards the hangar you notice that the rim of the hangar boasts great space-artillery pieces like outward pointing teeth in the cavernous mouth of a prehistoric monster. One of these pieces opens fire and although it is designed for long-range warfare its shell explodes close enough to damage the Flyer. You switch to reverse thrust, forced to crash land. As the Flyer bellies across the polished steel floor of the hangar complex it bathes the area in a sea of sparks. It will never fly again. You slip out of the crash-couch webbing and blow the cockpit seals so that you can get out of the wrecked Flyer. The inside of the building stretches into the distance, like a giant hovrail tunnel. To your left a much smaller access tunnel, perhaps thirty metres wide, stretches for a hundred metres towards an illuminated display board. Will you:

You run out of time before you have trained the lasers onto their target. The image of the missile completely fills the rear scanner screen as it hits you. There is a sickening lurch and a horrifying explosion, but you cannot believe it when, a second later, you are still alive. Evidently the defences of your Weeks/Senior Strike Fighter almost defy belief. The Atmos- pheric Interceptors fly through the blast and are destroyed.
I here is damage, however. You have lost 4 pointsfrom your Energy Shields or 7 points from your Titanium Hull Armour. If your ship's defences are at zero or below, all of the circuits overload, turn to 276. If you are above this figure, turn to 28.

Yelov's bionic reactions are even faster than they were before and your heavy-powered battlesuit is comparatively slow. He blocks your blow with his bionic arm and then kicks you in the chest. His machine leg carries enough force and weight to dent your battlesuit. Subtract 2 from your Suit Armour points.

Deadshot Yelov is too quick for you. The plasma bolt from his blaster rips a neat hole in the back of your suit. You fall stunned and the yellow gas of the Thrixian atmosphere invades your lungs. The plasnet of your suit tries to repair itself automati- cally, but Yelov turns down his blaster and uses it to keep the hole open. There is nothing you can do as your lungs turn to an acidified froth. Your death is indeed lingering and painful.

Suddenly you find yourself back in TIME headquarters, and the battlefield of Crecy is a fast-fading memory. Your actions have changed history. Count Louis de Nevers of Flanders survived the battle in which he should have been killed. His descendant is a brilliant young woman who scored even more highly than you in training at the Academy.

The revving whine of a hovbike sounds behind you. You whirl found to see Clone, lowlifer leader of the hovbike gang that tried to kill you for sport in a dead-end alley of Old Geneva. He has shaven off all but two spiking tufts of his gold-metal hair but he wears the same patchwork of robot parts and sharpened flangesthat he did then. The ram-fronted hovbike rears and he slips neatly off its back as it roars towards you. A lesser human would have been caught by the hovbike and crushed, but you spinaside and it hurtles past, collapsing into a set of wrought- iron park railings. 'You owe me, mutie upper,' Clone shouts madly. 'Your mindgames have made me a no-life. I've only one thingleft, Falcon, I'm not a street'roid any more, I just want to kill you.' A crowd of passers-by gathers and it irritates you that they stare at you as least as much as the outlandishly garbed madman. You decide to drop him, using your powers of Thinkstrike.He crumples senseless to the floor, a look of resigned rage upon his face, and you hand him over to the two Citpol Enforcers who have just arrived on the scene in a jetcopter.

Your power armour battlesuit has been breached and its power plant burns out. You are locked in position like a statue. The suit is too heavy for you to move it using your own strength. Yelov walks slowly up to you grinning evilly and says, 'I said it was kill or be killed, Falcon, and I meant it. I also promised when we met on Thrix that your death would be as lingering and painful as the technology of Mechanon could devise.' Yelov is true to his word. After two years of torture you are utterly insane, no better than a slavering beast. Yelov tires of his sport one day and orders your life-support system to be turned off.

The withering volleys from the English longbowmen take their loll of the valiant French knights again and again. The French knights come on in charge after charge, each time retiring to regroup.As they wait for each attack the English bowmen make a V sign with their fingers, indicating that they are ready with more arrows. From their conversation you can gather that it is the French custom to cut off their fingers with which they draw their bowstrings, if ever they are captured.
At last some of the French knights break through and there is fierce hand-to-hand fighting around the Black Prince's position. The Black Prince's horse is killed under him and he and his banner disappear from sight. A French knight whom you recognise from CAIN's descriptions of coats of arms, a strong lighter it seems, is met by a knight whose name, Sir Thomas Chandos, is called out in a warning by his squire. He is an important French noble, Louis de Nevers, Count of Flanders, whose surcoat is adorned with a rampant black lion. Your Psychic Awareness allows you to pick up a myriad thoughts in the din of battle - fear, pride, blood lust, and, somewhere, a strange blank. Sir Thomas Chandos could be struck dead at any time.

The lasers of two of the interceptor droids play havoc with the control surfaces of your Flyer and you can only switch to reverse thrust as you speed towards the ground, out of control.

The crash-couch webbing absorbs much of the impact but the whiplash is severe and you have broken a collar bone. Lose 8 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you extricate yourself from the mangled ruin of your Flyer and look around. The interceptors climbed steeply at the last moment to avoid the complex. You have lost them. The rim of the hangar boasts great space-artillery pieces like the cavernous maw of a prehistoric monster. The inside of the building stretches into the distance, like a giant hovrail tunnel.

Whilst you have been on Mechanon, a nuclear holocaust has ravaged Earth in 1986 AD. The nuclear winter caused by the dust which was flung into Earth's atmosphere was so severe that the whole world was covered in ice. Mankind was wiped out and you never existed. You have failed.


167
You return from the leisure park in time for a thorough rebriefing by section leaders Jobanque and Skirrow, and soon you are settled into the crash-couch of the first ever Weeks/Senior Corporation time travel Strike Fighter. You instruct your new version of CAIN to engage the Variac Drive and set coordinates for Mechanon 1986 AD. All goes grey and insubstantial, but after an hour in null-space you fail to materialise as planned. CAIN reports that there is a time flux disturbance. The droids of Mechanon have constructed a time flux destabiliser, trapping you in null-space! You can dimly see the factory planet below, hazy and insubstantial. CAIN says that you are trapped on a grid on which the timeholes of normal space have been forced into null-space. The Strike Fighter's sensors flash warning red and CAIN reports that the droids have sent five atomic mines equipped with anti-matter drives into the grid, one of which has just appeared in front of you and is hurtling towards you! The anti-matter drive enables the mines to travel across null-space anywhere in the grid of the destabilised field as if they were in real space. However, your Ion Drivewill not function here, you can only hop from timehole point to timehole on the grid, instantaneously, using the Variac Drive. Psychic awareness is of no use here, but because of the nature of the field the variac navigational computers will interpret coordinate inputs in the normal way. You must use your Variac Drive to shift to a new timehole point on the grid, as the four other atomic mines diverge towards all of the timehole points. If you don't, the mines will obliterate you. CAIN flashes up a picture of the grid on your face-up display. Which coordinates will you type into the console?

The conveyor belt absorbs the beam for a second, but it slices through the plasteel as if it were tender flesh. It is boring through to you when Carborundum causes the door of the furnace to fly open and a river of molten slag engulfs both it and the droid.

It is more difficult to dodge in the battlesuit than without it and the grab latches onto you, the four metal plates of its claw each as large as you.

You seize a part of the twisted rack and hurl it at Yelov, before sprinting off into the swirling mass of yellow fog. You hear Yelov ordering the wardroids to kill you; it seems he isn't going to risk staying on Thrix any longer. The wardroids roar overhead, trying to sense you. Will you:

CAIN opens a holo-link to Jobanque's office. Your new section leader is in deep thought, but looks up at you as you ask your question. 'I shall wait until you have decided your first move before I deploy the SAT Squad. I may send Bloodhound and Lynx to Mechanon if we do not hear from you within four hours, but I don't believe in letting everyone loose on the Timelines at once - there's no telling what might happen if two operatives are active within the same Timehole without knowing that a colleague is busy there too.'
You nod. 'I'm on my own then?' you ask.
Jobanque smiles, To begin with, at least. You'll survive, Falcon.'

You move quickly out to the back of the mining droid, where the conveyor belt has delivered about a hundred rods of pure Polybdenum onto a plasteel rack. There are no more wardroids to be seen. Three badly corroded loading droids stand motionless, ignoring you. You play your blaster across the rods and they glow red and begin to react with the chlorine in the Thrixian atmosphere, becoming a useless crumbling compound Carborundum thinks into your mind, thanking you for saving its life. He tells you that he was named after a form of carbon because he is considered unusual by the silicon Thrix, but that he is privileged to have contacted so unusual a being as you. He asks if you will become his silica-clone, and as this is apparently a great honour, you accept. Before you ask what a silica-clone is a machine shaped like a flying beetle appears in the yellow mist before you. A red light shines on its belly and a form glides to the ground on a disc of metal. With a shock you realise that it is a huge Time Machine and the form is that of the arch villain Agidy Yelov. A field of orange energy crackles around him. It seems he has stolen the force-field technology of the Creche. He is able to stand unprotected on Thrix, inside the defensive shield. Seeing you and the destroyed Polybdenum he screams with rage. The half of his face which you can see twists in a spasm and his robot arm twitches. In the wisps of yellow fog he looks like a foul demon from the blackest hell. He. shouts, 'I thought I had erased you from existence at the battle of Crecy. Falcon. You've meddled with my plans once again, but you cannot stop me this time, I have the most deadly arsenal the universe will ever know ready to obey my every command. I shall re-program every droid, Falcon, so that your death which is imminent will be as slow and painful as the technology of Mechanon can devise.' Just then two wardroids appear above the mining complex and, as you look up, Yelov draws his blaster. Carborundum sets up a keening wail which seems to disturb Yelov's force shield. He starts to choke as the deadly gas reaches his lungs and, stepping onto the disc, is sucked back up into the Time Machine, which winks out seconds later. Turn to 242.

As the French knights flow past you in pursuit of the English men at arms, hacking at you with their swords as they go, you concentrate your thoughts and hurl blast after blast of mental energy at them even while catching sword blows on your shield. You topple several from the saddle. The impetus of their charge slows and just at the right moment twenty English knights arrive, having been ordered to the Black Prince's position by King Edward when his son and his son's banner had been thrown to the ground. The English rally and after fierce fighting the French are repulsed once more. You regain the safety of Falcon's Wing, suffering no more than the mockery of some camp followers who think that you are fleeing the battle in fear. CAIN tells you that his scanners registered the fact that the Black Knight was a droid from Mechanon, and that it must have been programmed to kill Sir Thomas Chandos who is probably your ancestor. 'Be careful Falcon, Yelov is trying to kill you.' If you didn't know that electronic brains are not programmed to register emotion CAIN's tone would have you believe CAIN was worried on your behalf. You ask CAIN what effect the changes in history will have. CAIN is silent for some seconds before replying, 'King Edward will still take Calais from the French and most of the changes will be cancelled out by the terrible plague called the Black Death that will sweep Europe in two years' time.'
You can see on the console screen that the battle is continuing. The Black Prince is alive, another horse between his knees, and his standard has been raised once more. The camera zooms in on the leader of yet another French charge. CAIN tells you that the man in the visor-less helmet tied to two other knights who are leading his horse into battle is King John the Blind of Bohemia. Once again the French charge is broken by the English archers and is thrown back. You can see the blind king lying dead on the field,still tied to his brave knights. It is already dusk and the Englishhave almost won the day. There is nothing more for you to do here in mediaeval France. Turn to 294.

Your assailant is trapped and, realising the hopelessness of his position, he decides, instead of killing you, to surrender to you in the hope of being ransomed. You shake your head and move your aching shield arm gingerly as he is led away.

You hurtle onward like a bullet. After a few moments you see an enormous missile launcher ahead.

With a shuddering roar the huge missile pulls away from the launcher and accelerates towards you. You have no time to turn and it completely fills your screen. In desperation you fire your fission beam but to no avail. The missile erupts and its explosive force is doubled in this enclosed space. Your hull is breached and the tunnel collapses around you. A tangled mess of metal and rock will be your tomb for ever. You have failed.

Your blast of thought completely stuns Sir Thomas Chandos and he slumps to the ground just as he was aiming a great blow at Count Louis de Nevers. The Count of Flanders seeks a new foe as a huge English knight dressed from head to toe in black armour, carrying a shield which bears no device but is black as sable, stoops as if to help Chandos.

You shelter under the broken machinery of the worker droid. Pieces clang as they are cut from it to fall to the steel floor by the pulse lasers of the interceptors. They loop the loop and fire again on the return run, before arcing away, their drive reactors emitting a harsh whine. You continue towards the hangar-like entrance of the fluorescent building. The rim of the hangar boasts twenty great space-artillery pieces like outward pointing teeth in the cavernous maw of a prehistoric monster. As you approach it, skirting a huge iron cooling tower, an incredible sight meets your gaze. A spaceship almost as large as one of the generation starships of the 24th Century is being dismantled on a huge brass landing field. As you fly over it you see a contraption which can only be an enlarged Variac Drive being hoisted out of its front end. It takes a few seconds for you to realise what has been happening. The factory droids must have manufactured this colossal Time Machine in hours! Hundreds of them hover about it. They must have planned to invade the EigerVault with this machine on Earth, 3033 AD. Now that you havedestroyed the Polybdenum and the Timehole on Thrix has closed, Yelov must have altered his plans. As you streak onwards, a daunting vista opens up beneath you. It is Mechanon's space launch field, and it is packed with an interstellar warfleet the size of which defies belief. Row upon row of Interceptors, Ion-drive Battle Cruisers and Atmospheric fighter-carrying Mother-ships glow a burnished bronze beneath the dull red sky. At the hangar mouth, worker droids are cutting part of the Time Machine apart in a blaze of heat and light. Will you:

You ask for information on Thrix and Crecy and CAIN tells you that Thrix is a planet rich in Polybdenum, the rare mineral which the Variac Drives and Molecular Converters of Time Machines use as fuel. It is inhabited by strange intelligent rock-like life forms. Crecy is in Earth's past at the time of a battle- between mediaeval knights in armour which was the first in the Hundred Years War.

Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and using your Psychic Awareness locate the timehole at Crecy.

A pulse of energy from the weapon banks of the second droid hurls you against the rocky remains of a dead Thrix. Your suit is ruptured. Lose 10 Endurance points. The wounds will heal badly - subtract 1 from your maximum Endurance points permanently. If you are still alive, you roll aside and blast again. Your aim is true and you have destroyed the other wardroid's hover pads.

The immobile wardroid is preparing to open up at you with its laser cannon - you have an instant in which to dodge the beam and destroy the droid. You evade the questing beam of the wardroid's laser cannon and return fire at the immobile death machine. The lancing bolt of white-hot energy hits its power plant, hurling debris everywhere and your helmet faceplate flash defence cuts in, darkening automatically as the bright explosion lights the yellow atmosphere.

CAIN tells you that his scanners registered the fact that the Black Knight was a droid from Mechanon, and that it must have been programmed to kill Sir Thomas Chandos who is probably your ancestor. 'Be careful, Falcon, Yelov is trying to kill you.' If you didn't know that electronic brains are not programmed to register emotion, CAIN's tone would have you believe he was worried on your behalf. You can see on the console screen that the English are losing the battle, but it is too late for you to do anything about it. You ask CAIN to evaluate the extent to which history has been changed. CAIN purrs quietly for some moments before reporting that, whilst the Black Prince lives, most of the French leaders have been killed, with the exception of Count Louis de Nevers who will now kill the ancestor of the man who invented the energy deflector shields for Federation warships, at the battle of Poitiers. Note down on your Adventure Sheet that Count Louis survived the battle of Crecy and Zeiss, the inventor of deflector shields, never lived.

As you steal towards the hangar you hear the sound of an alarm. You look to the source and see an infra-red scanner. Twenty gleaming barrels, the space-artillery, composed of a grill-like mesh of metal alloys, dip down ponderously towards you.

Noxious vapours stream in around you and Yelov is propelled, choking, to a hatch in the side of the tunnel that opens by the raildroid's grav-beam. You fire a rocket and then jet towards him, but he is through the hatchway in a twinkling. The droid's shield blocks the rocket, but the explosion damages its circuitry and it jars to a standstill. Using your particle disrupter you carve a hole in the tunnel wall and fly through it, after Yelov. Turn to 412.

You are taken to the Speaking House, a building neither more nor less grandiose than any of the Others, and given the chance to speak to those who have volunteered to play a part in governing the planet. There are twenty-seven of the Danikoi who recline on plush couches that float in the air. They elect one called the Disputer to argue against you. You have no choice but to tell them you are a Time Traveller and the reasons you have journeyed to their world and time. Your own people on Earth and the Federation will be killed if they allow Mechanon to be turned into a lasting monument to their technological knowhow. They hear you out without interruption and when you have finished the Disputer says that they have no plans to build a factory planet anywhere. You reply that they will begin building on Mechanon in five thousand years. There is a general hum and one of the Danikoi asks you why their descendants should wish to do this. You reply, 'I know only that they will choose to do so. In my time, fifty millenia from now, it is history.' The hum this time is louder. The Disputer stands and asks you to prove that you are a Time Traveller. Will you:

Falcon's Wing settles onto the rocky surface of Thrix with a crunch and a whine from its hydraulic legs. CAIN warns you that the soupy, yellow atmosphere of Thrix is highly corrosive, so you put on your environment suit. The inhabitants of this world live for many thousands of years and are composed almost entirely of glass, like silica. They are telepathic and can also move objects by thought alone. The camera shows ghostly outcroppings of jagged rock, swimming in soupy gases. Soon after you have stepped outside, the gases seem to thicken into a fog and you are forced to halt until visibility improves. Just as you catch sight of a huge machine bristling with weaponry, everything goes black. Your ancestor has been killed at the Battle of Crecy on Earth in 1346 AD. It is as if you had never existed. You have failed

You are unable to shake it off. It homes in on you; its image completely fills the scanner screen as it hits you head on. There is a sickening lurch and a horrifying explosion but you cannot believe it when, a second later, you are still alive. Evidently the defences of your Weeks/Senior Strike Fighter almost defy belief. There is damage, however, you have lost 4 points from your Energy Shields or 7 points from your Titanium Hull Armour.

Well done. You arrive at the point on the grid which corresponds to a Timehole on Rigel Prime. The display on your faceplate shows that the mine at Mechanon has exploded and died away.

You open fire again and this time your plasma beam fuses the wardroid's gun mountings, allowing you to play your beam over it for some time. The yellow gas turns red in a great cloud around it as the metal of the droid fuses and collapses in on itself, into a molten mass. It carried a radar beacon which has now stopped functioning. You can see four more of the hovering wardroids, one at each corner of the gargantuan mining droid and you realise it will not be long before they register that the droid which attacked you is out of action. At the back of the mining droid is a loading bay stacked with thin rods of ore. You creep across the rocky terrain towards the loading bay. Turn to 252.

You fly towards the raildroid and set off two rockets before training your particle disruptor on Yelov. The droid's shield moves into place in front of Yelov and its outer edge must be in a stasis field for it is unaffected even by a particle disruptor. Yelov's accuracy with his blaster is breathtaking as he shoots down both of the rockets before they reach him. The raildroid hums as it accelerates along the rail towards you. You jet away but you are too late. You are caught and held in mid-air by its grav-beam. Once more Yelov displays his skill with the blaster as he aims it at the faceplate of your battlesuit. The high tensile plexiglass is vapourised and Yelov pauses to sneer before doing the same to your face. You have failed.

Falcon's Wing rematerialises on Mechanon, which is a gleaming orb of polished metals. Robo-factories stretch as far as the eye can see, covering every inch of the planet's surface, almost without light in the sombre red sky. At three mile intervals around you are what must be planetary defence points: bronze domes bristling with some sort of surface-to-space artillery. Your scanners indicate that nothing lives on this dead world, not even grass, but it is alive with bizarrely-shaped droids which dart and scuttle across its face like insects. You decide to explore on foot and set out towards a building which glows a ghostly green. You move swiftly but are not far enough from Falcon's Wing to escape the blast of an incoming missile. You are hurled through the air and smash into the base of a huge iron cooling tower as Falcon's Wing is blown to smithereens. As you regain consciousness and realise that you are trapped in time on Mechanon, all goes dark. Your ancestor has been killed at the Battle of Crecy on Earth in 1346 AD. It is as if you had never existed. You have failed.

CAIN replies that the technology possessed by the decadent Danikoi who programmed the self-replicating droids which turned Mechanon into one great factory was at least as advanced as that possessed by a member of the Space Federation in 3033 AD. The fearsome array of space weapons made by these machines is the most deadly arsenal the galaxy has ever seen. This arsenal includes potent nuclear devices, floating fortress platforms and spaceships which are all vast robots.

You duck back inside the mining droid and run back through the length of it and down into the cave at its mouth once more Carborundum guides you back through the miasmal fog to Falcon's Wing. It thinks of you as a mere space traveller and you do nothing to let it realise that you have come from the far future. You tell it that the droids remaining on Thrix will soon be disabled by the corrosive atmosphere, and that if you are successful it and its kind will never be troubled by them again When it realises you are leaving it becomes sad, and its mind touches yours once more. It is hoping that you will meet again one day and it says that it will travel a thousand years to find you if you tell it which star your planet circles. You shake your head, its sadness is infectious, and say that you cannot tell it. Indeed you have to tell it never to try to find out.

Your thumbs depress the fusion beam fire buttons on the joystick but you mis-timed the shot and the twin blasts of energy destroy some worker droids busy in front of the fortress.

Your mental effort is not enough to stun the French nobleman; he is strong-willed and phlegmatic of temperament.

A: Agidy Yelov is using the wardroids of Mechanon to build an impregnable fortress on the inhospitable planet Thrix where he can make himself safe from the Space Federation who might be happy to leave him there to rot.

B: Agidy Yelov is moving the wardroids of Mechanon to the planet Thrix before they are destroyed by the nuclear catastrophe on Mechanon where he will hide them until he is ready to attack Earth by moving them into the timehole at the Eiger Vault in 3033 AD.

283
Nevers, stunned and bewildered, is led behind the English lines Suddenly you see an English knight in black armour whose shield bears no device but is as black as sable. He is raising his mace which seems to crackle with a blue aura ready to strike Sir Thomas Chandos. You cannot detect any thoughts at all inside the great black helm. Will you:

CAIN is silent for some moments before chiming, There is a correspondence between the names of members of the English nobility who were present at the battle of Crecy and the earliest of your known ancestors, Falcon. Sir Thomas Chandos, whose coat of arms is a silver falcon on a blue background may have been a distant ancestor of yours. I assume you know that a coat ofarmsisthepicturecarriedonaknight'sshieldandsurcoatina battle of those times? If Sir Thomas Chandos is murdered before his time, Falcon, you will never have existed.'
Thank you CAIN,' you reply, 'and CAIN, has it ever crossed your memory banks that even you don't know everything? I have the information I need now.'
'If I may be permitted to add something, sir?' There is an almost wheedling note to the chimes of CAIN's voice synthesiser, rather than the usual slightly haughty tone.
'Now what?' you ask.
'I can compute no sure reason for a visit to Crecy to change history. A disease called the Black Death, a plague which killed between a quarter and a half of the population of Europe followed two years later, in 1348 AD. Its effects may dampen any changes that may be caused in Earth's timeline at this point.'
'Set coordinates for Crecy, 26th August, 1346 AD, CAIN,' you order brusquely. Turn to 322.

288
Your blaster plays against one of the droids and its metal armour begins to glow, but both have locked onto you with their laser cannon and you are cut into seven separate pieces. You have failed.

289
You open fire but miss, and then dash in a zig-zag pattern towards the wardroids. The Atmospheric Interceptor opens fire with a laser strike which misses you, destroying several of the luminous green panels. It screams overhead and out of the tunnel, unable to turn at such speed. You fire again at one of the approaching raildroids, but the convex shield which it carries swings into position and deflects your blast in a flare of light. The second raildroid opens up with an unusual green ray. You t r y to make the cover of a part-dismantled worker droid. Make an Evasion Roll.

CAIN responds, 'It is not within the capability of this Strike Fighter to destroy the planet killer. There is only one thing that can be done. You will have to break the First Law of TIME, Falcon. There is a timehole, fifty millenia ago, on Danikos. You must try and change history so that the Danikoi will never build Mechanon. Remember, Falcon, the Danikoi were far more ad- vanced than any other species in the galaxy at that time. You must try to convince them not to allow Earth to be destroyed. You set coordinates for Danikos fifty thousand years ago. Your Strike Fighter has no Autodoc but you have time to dress any wounds you have suffered while you are in the void of null- space. Restore up to 2 points of lost Endurance points and turn to 105.

291
Your thumb presses down on the joystick firing buttons, but you acted too soon and the twin beams disintegrate a set of sensor banks. You have no time to do anything before two plasma shells explode on your front shields with an awful crackling roar. Your ship is engulfed in a great ball of white plasma. The heat is unbearable and you look up in horror to see your front screens filling with three missiles. They slam into the ship, ripping the hull open. You are consumed in a massive explosion. You have failed.

292
The android has turned its blaster to maximum and its beam sears into you. Lose 9 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you roll out of the beam and then unleash the energy of your blaster, taking even the superhuman android by surprise. You play the beam across it until it is completely vapourised and then set off across the countryside in search of your Strike Fighter. Turn to 135.

293
Your fission beams do not find their target until it is already too late. The huge missile completely fills the scanner screen as it hits you head on. There is a sickening lurch and a horrifying explosion but you cannot believe it when, a second later, you are still alive. Evidently the defences of your Weeks/Senior Strike Fighter almost defy belief. There is damage, however. You have lost 4 points from your Energy Shields or 7 points from your Titanium Hull Armour.

In the safety of Falcon's Wing you reconsider the situation. The disturbances in the timelines of the two planets, Thrix and Mechanon, are clearly related. As time is pressing and Yelov has bought himself several hours by tying you up here at Crecy you decide to ask for just one more item of information. Will you ask CAIN:

You insert the tip of your sword into the gap where the Count's helm meets his breastplate and drive it home. His windpipe is severed and he dies frothing blood inside the darkness of his helmet. One of the English knights curses you for a fool, saying that you could have held him for ransom. Suddenly, you see an English knight in black armour whose shield bears no device but is as black as sable. He is raising his mace to strike Sir Thomas Chandos and it seems to crackle with a blue aura. You cannot detect any thought at all inside the great black helm. Will you:

303
The faceplate of your helmet darkens automatically as the fluid reacts with the crystals to compensate for the glare of your exploding grenade which landed right next to the Polybdenum. The rods of ore are destroyed but one of the wardroids has locked onto you and it reacts with the speed that only a robot boasts. A pulse of energy leaves its weapon bank and you are hurled backwards. Lose 10 Endurance points. If you are still alive, your suit repairs itself before the acid atmosphere of Thrix can enter. As quick as thought, you send another grenade hurtling towards the droid. Turn to 263.

304
Your fusion beams set the missile off but it explodes too close to you for comfort. The forward scanner screen is filled with rolling jets of flame and the ship rocks, its gyros whining. Your ship's defences have lost another 2 points (Armour or Shields). If they are at zero or below, turn to 282. If they are not you fly on. Turn to 351.

305
At last you knock his sword aside and cleave the air with a mighty cut that embeds your sword in his side. He tumbles from his horse, snapping his neck as he hits the ground just as the sword of Sir Thomas Chandos whistles through the air where he would have been but for your blow. A chill feeling of fear takes you in case you have changed history but as you wait and nothing happens you guess that perhaps Chandos killed Louis de Nevers in history. Before you can breathe you see an English knight in black armour whose shield bears no device but is as black as sable. He is raising his mace to strike Sir Thomas Chandos and it seems to crackle with a blue aura. You cannot detect any thought at all inside the great black helm. Will you:

A controlled explosion forces a core of molten metal through the suit and you explode inside it when it drills into your body. The last sound you hear is Yelov's vengeful howl of joy.

307
Your will to live pulls you through the terrible battle with the maniac will of Yelov. Sweating with the effort inside your battlesuit, you manage to throw off his attempt to take control of your mind but his mind is as quick as his reflexes and before you can attack him he hurls a blast of mental energy at you. You use your Power of Will to overcome his Thinkstrike which threatens to reduce you to a grovelling animal. Make a Power of Will Roll.

The beacon should have been destroyed by now but it is still live, according to Agent Chameleon. If we assume that Yelov has saved Mechanon he must have a different reason for visiting the planet Thrix.' Where will you set coordinates for?

You stand and hurl your grenade which arcs through the gaseous mist towards the wardroid and then pull your blaster. The electronic circuitry of the droid reacts faster than thought and a pulse of energy from its weapon banks picks you up and hurls you bodily against a rock outcropping. The plasnet of your suit repairs itself automatically but the blast and the acid gas of Thrix's atmosphere which seeped into your suit have reducedyour Endurance by 10 points. If you are still alive, the contaminated wounds will heal poorly - subtract 1 from your maximum Endurance points forever. Your grenade explodes, destroying the hover pads of the wardroid which falls to the rocky ground, immobilised. In a split second you have recovered and unleashed a lancing bolt of white-hot energy which hits its power plant and the flash defence on your helmet automatically cuts in and the faceplate darkens as the lurid explosion lights the yellow atmosphere, hurling debris everywhere. You have destroyed the wardroid that guards the loading bay but other robots may be on their way to intercept you.

If you survive, the gyros stabilise the ship and you hurtle downward as the second plasma shell passes overhead and explodes in the tunnel behind you filling it with burning white plasma. You pull up, hugging the ground. The fortress lies directly ahead and three sleek and deadly dart-shaped missiles fly from one of its bases, launch up behind, and dive in unison towards you. Instinctively you fire fission beams which lance out across the surface and into the fortress, destroying its plasma turrets.

As you have just spent an hour of your life in null-space you may restore up to 12 points of lost Endurance points through the use of your Autodoc. You rematerialise on Mechanon at the same instant that you left Thrix in real time, but as your camera surveys the horizon there is no sign of Yelov or his newly manufactured Time Machine. Mechanon is a gleaming orb of polished metals Robo-factories stretch as far as the eye can see, covering every inch of the planet's surface, almost without light in the sombre red of Mechanon's sky. You have landed on the sloping roof of a refinery and a motionless mining droid overshadows Falcon's Wing. At three mile intervals around you are what must be planetary defence points: bronze domes bristling with some sort of surface-to-space artillery. Between two of these bases is the yawning entrance of a building which is clearly more than a factory. As the camera zooms in, a large flying droid disappears into it, trailing a greenish line of vapour. Your scanners indicate that nothing lives on this dead world, not even grass, but it is alive with bizarrely-shaped droids which fly and scuttle across its face like insects. The sky is laced with power-lines which stretch from pylons atop the factories, and on the towering peak of one of these a radar dish is sweeping in a slow arc towards Falcon's Wing. CAIN tells you Mechanon's atmosphere is harmful to human life and you decide to get into your environment suit again. It also used the molecular converter to create a Universal Interface, saying: 'Insert the Interface into any Central Computer Communications access point and it will extract as much information as it can from Mechanon's Central Computer memory banks about the wardroid's plans, Falcon Good luck!'

The transition into null-space and back again is smooth - too smooth! You miss the slight jar that usually shakes Falcon's Wing as the hydraulic legs adjust to the ground above which you rematerialise. The camera shows a thin mist, then you sit up and stare as a ghostly shape floats upwards past you. It looks like a series of metal girders riveted together with a crude rocket engine welded on at the back. The girders are braced by metal struts atop which a large crystal or faceted boulder rests. Your stomach leaps into your throat - the crude spaceship with its open-to-the-stars construction is not climbing, you are falling through the dense Thrixian atmosphere and you have just seen a Thrixian starship. Your altimeter shows 460 metres and you are gaining speed or accelerating at 10 metres per second from the stationary position in which you were held as you emerged from null-space. You have no retro-rockets - the only way to stop Falcon's Wing plummeting to destruction is to engage the Variac Drive and throw your Time Machine back into null-space and then back into Thrix, 1776 AD. If you get the timing exactly right, you may be able to wink out and return only inches above the surface. When will you instruct CAIN to engage the Variac Drive?

Nothing happens. CAIN advises you that you can only move to a point on the grid which corresponds to a timehole. The radiation dampers overload and you suffer severe radiation poisoning. Even if you find a way out of the grid, you will die within minutes. The sophisticated trap set up by the wardroids of Mechanon has caught you in its deadly jaws.

322
You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational coordinates for the timehole at Crecy, France, 1346 AD. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and using your Psychic Awareness locate the timehole at Crecy. When you have translated this location into coordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish, and gain up to 12 Endurance points. Turn to 6.

With uncanny accuracy you thrust the sword through the open visor into the droid's computer brain. It folds up and then locks solid, its circuits dead.

Nearest you, on the radar, is what can only be a weather control satellite - it has seeding pods and chemical condenser beams to generate clouds and rainfall. CAIN tells you that Mechanon, before the arrival of the Danikoi, was ravaged by terrible ion storms and hurricane-force winds. But the weather control satellites prevent these.
As you approach the weather satellite CAIN chimes again: 'Look at the radar. Falcon.' There is an intruder detection satellite beyond the weather controller. It has already detected the Strike Fighter's ion drive and beamed a message to the Central Computer on Mechanon. Your twin fission tubes are ready to fire. Will you turn them against:

Your rocket hits the interceptor which explodes with a roar and a clang as half of it cannons into the side of the tunnel. The hunter-seeker fixes itself onto the back of your battlesuit. Warning lights flash as the suit's sensors tell you that the hunter-seeker is an armour piercing device. A controlled explosion forces a core of molten metal through the suit and you explode inside it when it drills into your body. The last sound you hear is Yelov's vengeful howl of joy.

330
Ten seconds after you emerge into the Thrixian atmosphere Falcon's Wing impacts on the rocky surface of Thrix. It is destroyed utterly and the shock is too much for your frail human body. The acid atmosphere of Thrix scalds your panting lungs and you die. You have failed.

331
You make it to the access tunnel and although this one has a rail it is not connected to those on which the raildroids which attacked you are resting. The scream of the Atmospheric Interceptor which has turned outside the complex and has now returned, almost deafens you, but it cannot turn into this narrow tunnel. Turn to 280.

Nothing happens. CAIN tells you that the grid exists in only two dimensions, you have tried to move in a third dimension. The radiation dampers overload and you suffer severe radiation poisoning. Even if you find a way out of the grid, you will die within minutes. The sophisticated trap set up by the wardroids of Mechanon has caught you in its deadly jaws.

333
You choose a high arcing trajectory for the throw of your grenade but one of the wardroids, reacting with superhuman speed, shoots up and smashes into the grenade in mid air, causing it to explode before it hits the Polybdenum. The wardroid is immobilised, its gyros gone, and it crashes to the ground, though it is still functional. The other wardroid has locked onto you, however, and it fires at you with a pulse of energy from one of its weapon banks that catches you in the thigh. Lose 8 Endurance points. If you are still alive, your suit has begun to repair itself in time to prevent any of the atmosphere entering and you leap for cover. Turn to 345.

CAIN selects a simple coat of arms for you, a red chevron on a white background and prepares a sword, shield and armour in the molecular converter. You glide to the ground, looking for all the world like an English man-at-arms, and an atmosphere of tense expectancy hits you. As you step away from Falcon's Wing, around which the hologram of a group of trees is projected, battle is about to be joined. The Genoese cross- bowmen are charging towards the Black Prince and his knights. You clank down the slope and take up a position in the rear rank, sword at the ready. The Genoese halt suddenly and let loose a volley of crossbow bolts - the thud of one hitting your shield with great force shocks you as you realise that you could die at any moment. A few of the English fall under the hail of flying steel but the English longbowmen let loose a volley. The sky is blackened by a great mass of arrows and they fall upon the Genoese in a withering cloud. The Genoese mercenaries must rewind their crossbows before they can fire again, whereas the English archers, tall, deep-chested men, can fire an arrow with deadly precision every six or eight seconds. The Genoese veterans have never faced such a rain of death and they panic and flee within moments. The French knights are so incensed at this that they ride down their own men in their frenzied charge. All nobles, they treat the Genoese mercenary soldiers with contempt.

The twin fission beams meet and play across the surface of the intruder detection satellite and an opaque sphere of violet light surrounds it. It is a defence shield and although you play the beams across it for as long as you can, it still holds. CAIN alerts you to three guided missiles which the satellite is causing to home in on you from the dull red surface of Mechanon.

You come to an enormous blue wall of pulsing energy, completely blocking off the corridor - an energy zone field. Below it is a droid generator, a huge metal block draped with power cables. It is lined from left to right with a row of projectors connected to receptors around the walls and roof of the corridor by wide bands of crackling blue energy, the force field.

The Disputer turns from you and confers with the others. Some are saying that it will cost them nothing to make a law against the building of a factory planet. Another says that if they are not concerned with the future it doesn't matter if they do anyway This amuses them and they turn to you and say that you can have your wish.

The twin fission beams meet at the point where the weather satellite tumbles gently through space and trigger a chain reaction which sunders the satellite, leaving nothing but the clear emptiness of space behind. The intruder detection satellite has homed in on you and it is guiding three surface-to-space missiles which streak towards you from the dull red world of Mechanon. You decide to use electronic counter measures, hoping to detonate the missiles before they meet you. This calls for precise judgement as you try to calculate their speed and course.

As you dodge out to fire again at the raildroids as they accelerate towards you, the scream of the Atmospheric Interceptor fills the air. It has turned outside the complex and dived back in behind you. As you spin to face it a missile hits you full on the chest. The explosion shakes the whole complex, but the impact alone would have killed you. You have failed.

348
You have timed your fall perfectly. Falcon's Wing settles onto the rocky surface of Thrix with a crunch and a whine from its hydraulic legs. CAIN warns you that the soupy yellow atmosphere of Thrix is highly corrosive and you put on your environment suit. Whilst you are doing so, CAIN gives you some valuable information on the planet and its inhabitants. The flying girders which you passed in the atmosphere were a primitive form of starship powered by chemical rockets like those used on Earth in the 21st and 22nd centuries. The ships are slow but the pilot, a Thrix, has a lifespan of several millenia and being composed almost entirely of glass-like silica can exist in deep space. The rock-like Thrix are telepathic and can move objects by thought alone. They are dormant at deep space temperatures but regain the capacity for thought whenever their ship nears a sun. Less than two thousand remain on their home world - the reason for their decline is not known. Very little is known about their attitude to aliens in 3033 AD, let alone this time. They are not members of the Federation (they will not become members, that is). 'There is one other thing, Falcon - this timehole is deteriorating rapidly and will soon cease to exist. I estimate anything between one and six hours remaining before it fades away. Take care not to get trapped here!' You thank CAIN. The camera shows ghostly outcroppings of jagged rock, swimming in soupy gases. You leave Falcon's Wing - without preparing a disguise (CAIN does not have the relevant information stored in his memory banks in any case) and set out to explore. Before you have gone twenty metres you see a shiny black boulder, faceted like a diamond, but three metres tall. It is a Thrix. Will you:

Nothing happens. CAIN tells you that the grid exist in only two dimensions, you have tried to move in a third dimension. The radiation dampers overload and you suffer severe radiation poisoning. Even if you find a way out of the grid, you will die within minutes. The sophisticated trap set up by the wardroids of Mechanon has caught you in its deadly jaws.

CAIN selects a simple coat of arms for you, a red chevron on a white background, and prepares a sword, shield and armour in the molecular convertor. You glide to the ground, looking for all the world like an English man-at-arms, and an atmosphere of tense expectancy hits you. As you step away from Falcon's Wing, around which the hologram of a group of trees is projected, battle is about to be joined. The Genoese cross- bowmen are charging towards the Black Prince and his knights. You clank down the slope and take up a position in the rear rank, behind the King, sword at the ready. His advisers are asking him whether they should send help to his young son but he replies, 'Let the boy win his spurs.' The Genoese halt suddenly and let loose a volley of crossbow bolts - the thud of one hitting your shield with great force shocks you as you realise that you could die at any moment. A few of the English fall under the hail of flying steel, but the English longbowmen let loose a volley. The sky is blackened by a great mass of arrows and they fall upon the Genoese in a withering cloud. The Genoese mercenaries must rewind their crossbows before they can fire again, whereas the English archers, tall, deep-chested men, can fire an arrow with deadly precision every six or eight seconds. The Genoese veterans have never faced such a rain of death and they panic and flee within moments. The French knights are so incensed at this that they ride down their own men in their frenzied charge.

You surge forward towards the Central Computer Complex and the cavernous mouth of the hangar lined with space- artillery. A huge cavernous tunnel stretches away beyond the hangar mouth and a motley assortment of droids are being repaired at intervals along it. Three rails run the length of it, some distance from the floor. A huge access portal opens briefly and an Atmospheric Interceptor zooms out of it towards you.

Your ship out-accelerates the Mechanon starship and you match speed with it a fraction before reaching hyper-space velocity. You make the fine adjustments which will point you towards Earth and set the jump for a length of 9.36754 parsecs. You go into hyper-space together and the stars form a tunnel around you. Ahead the stars which shoot towards you are neon blue, at the sides they are long streaks of white and yellow, and as you crane your head backwards you can see that you are leaving behind stars which glow redly, at a breathtaking rate. Both ships leave hyper-space near the moon. You are four thousand miles behind and below the Mechanon starship. It is not responding to your presence, your radar dampers must be effective, if the droidship is scanning. You arm your missiles, ready to attack if the starship threatens Earth, but to your surprise, it merely discharges a small re-entry capsule, from its belly.

The computer's tones are calm once more as it says, 'You must leave now, intruder.' Ignoring it, you look around for what may be the computer's core. It is difficult to tell one part of the enormous electronic brain from another so you decide to use your particle disruptor on all of it. As its memory banks are destroyed one by one the computer threatens you that the whole planet will explode, killing you, if you continue. As your beam of destruction creeps towards a large steel pyramid the computer's tone changes to a wheedling whine. 'Cease immediately, intruder, or I shall launch the planet killer at Earth.' Still ignoring it, you play your beam across the pyramid which seems to melt away to nothing as if by magic. Suddenly everything goes haywire. Lights flash everywhere and then dim as the main generators shut down. You manage to find your way back out of the tunnel in the darkness by the searchlight of your battlesuit helmet and climb into your Strike Fighter once more. The sound of distant explosions rocks the tunnel as you climb into your crash-couch. To your relief the ion drives are operational again now that they have cooled down, and you gun the fighter through the blackness of the tunnel, aiming for the white pin pricks of the stars of Mechanon's night sky at its end. There is a blinding flash and the tunnel is filled with light as another immense explosion rocks the complex, and the walls begin to cave in on you. You make it to the end of the tunnel just in time and hurtle skyward. Turn to 411.

You contact CAIN using your battlesuit access terminal (BAT) and it is able to help you. It is fashionable at this period of the history of the Danikoi for eminent Danikoi to prophesy what will happen 500 years after they die. One such prophecy is due to be read in a month's time. CAIN is able to tell you exactly what it will say. You ask the decision makers to read the prophecy now instead of waiting the last few days. They consult a computer terminal and order the prophecy to be read. It causes a great hum of laughter but it is exactly as you predicted and they believe you are a traveller in time. The Disputer now says, 'I believe your story, but the events of fifty millenia in the future have no meaning for we who must eat, laugh and love in the short span of our own lives. Why should we care about the future?' There is a chorused hum of agreement amongst the Danikoi. Will you say:

That Earth will become the head and protector of a Federation of planets, one of which is Danikos, for the time will come when you can no longer protect yourselves?
That the future is important: 'Surely you want your children to live happy lives - what of their children, and their children's children? Surely you would not condemn an entire generation of your people to untimely death?'

The Battle computer locks onto its target and your finger stabs out to the button that launches the fission warhead. It streaks away from you and hammers into the generator with a great roar.

Before you can fire, one of the wardroids fires four shells from a mortar-cluster housing.

As you follow the capsule down, the flare of its re-entry licks towards you like a rocket exhaust and you use your retros to control your speed of descent. The capsule is too low and too near to a large city for you to risk attacking. It too has radar damping and you are forced to track it visually, cursing quietly as it leads you within five miles of a large 20th century airliner. Perhaps you look like a shooting star to its passengers. Hoping you have escaped notice you follow the capsule into the night side of Earth as its parachute opens, and set the Strike Fighter down in a field. You climb hastily out of your battlesuit and curse once more as you remember the Weeks/Senior Corpora- tion have not yet had time to install a hologram projector or molecular convertor. You ask CAIN's advice and he tells you that you are in Devon, a county in the democratic country of England, and that you might escape serious notice if you pretend to be an American film star in a cinematograph of the far-future, which the people of England would call a science fiction film. You jump down from the Strike Fighter and scan the area with your infra-red goggles. An android, it is too cool to be a human, is moving towards a stream of moving lights, one mile away. You run after him and in the lights, which turn out to be the front searchlights of combustion engined vehicles which roll along a tarmacadam strip, you see that the android looks like a man dressed in clothes from far history.

You crouch in the trench, along which a heavy opaque green gas pours like a stream. To your surprise the great rock begins to roll along past you and is swallowed up in the yellow fog. You leave the trench and walk warily in the direction from which it came. There is a slight movement in the heavy air and the fog lifts slightly to reveal the most enormous mechanical contrap- tion shaped like a long armadillo. Dust rises from its form and it rumbles slowly across the surface of the planet towards you on caterpillar tracks. Its body is composed of overlapping segments of metal like a woodlouse, which glow dully in the dull rays of the Thrixian sun, which barely penetrates the thick atmos- phere. Thrix is cold. Turn to 395.

Your thumbs press down on the joystick firing buttons and twin fission beams leap from the Fighter's wing tips, nearly vapourising the launcher and causing the missiles to explode, destroying much of the fortress' sensor banks. Before you can do anything further, two plasma shells slam into the hull of your ship with a crackling roar and you are engulfed in a ball of burning white plasma. Lose 2 Shield points or 3 Armour. If your defence points are below zero, turn to 90. If you have survived, your Strike Fighter bucks wildly but the gyros, whining shrilly, manage to right it. You are brought to a standstill but engage the booster thrusters and surge forward over the fortress, the G-force dampers working overtime. Turn to 71.

The arrogant Danikoi are not interested in a future in which they are not the most powerful beings. The Disputer says, 'If we can no longer protect ourselves then let it all end. Our species will no longer be fit for survival.' They turn their backs on you and you cannot make them listen. There is nothing that you can do now which will stop the Danikoi using time travel to mould history to their own decadent whims. Suddenly, everything goes dark. The Danikoi have changed history and it is as if you and the Space Federation had never existed.

375
Too late you realise that the twenty space-artillery cannons are trained towards you. They fire simultaneously and twenty plasma bolts explode all around you. Your ship's defences, incredibly, stand up to this battering, but they are almost useless now. You scream into the cavernous tunnel and two raildroids whir along their raits towards you. You score a hit on one but the particle disrupter beam of the other pierces your defences. The Strike Fighter is consumed in a ball of flame as its drive overloads and you are destroyed with it. You have failed.

376
Your Strike Fighter re-materialises in the Eiger Vault, 3033 AD. It shows no sign of the damage it suffered on Mechanon. You ask CAIN how long. Earth time, you have been away on the factory planet. To your utter consternation CAIN says it can find no trace of anything called Mechanon in its databanks. You hurry to TIME headquarters to report to Jobanque for your debriefing. When the door to his office slides back he seems surprised to see you. Turn to 420.

As you step away from Falcon's Wing, around which the hologram of a group of trees is projected, battle is about to be joined.

A few of the English fall under the hail of flying steel, but the English longbowmen let loose a volley. The sky is blackened by a great mass of arrows and they fall upon the Genoese in a withering cloud.

You re-emerge behind the Mechanon starship once more, but this time it is the dull red of the factory planet which hangs beneath you, not the white cratered moon of Earth.

As your missile arrows down towards the fortress you can see several small laser cluster banks swivelling to track it. They open fire and strands of ruby light lance out and cut through the missile. It explodes with a thunderous roar before it reaches the fortress, but it does conceal you behind rolling flames for a few moments from the fortress and you streak over it. As the smoke and flames clear you can see that a missile rack is still following your course and three sleek and deadly dart-shaped missiles leap from the launcher and hurtle towards you.

As you watch, a huge English knight in black armour who bears no coat of arms raises his mace against one of his fellows. The great blow falls and you are engulfed in darkness. One of your ancestors has been slain - it is as if you had never existed. Now Agidy Yelov will rule the Federation.

You stride on through the yellow mist, slowed by the high gravity, towards the armadillo-like mining droid. Suddenly the mist churns before you and out of it bursts a large wardroid, hovering ten feet up, on four large discs - hover thrusters. Its top part is crammed with sensors and other indefinable electronic gear, protected by heavy armour. It has several weapon banks - laser cannon, mortar-tube clusters, Ion Beam energy weapons, hi-explosive machine rifles and so on. A huge swivelling gun is moving to target on you. You must blast it before it blasts you. Make an Attack Roll.

The din of metal striking metal rings all about you as the French knights ride amongst the English. All is confusion as the English seek to drag the French from their horses while defending, shields raised, against the blows of their swords. You move back, but the Black Prince is hard pressed and whilst you are deciding whether to aid him a French knight in a great visored helmet bears down on you with a lance. Will you:

You sprint away from Falcon's Wing as three ballistic missiles streak overhead.

The third missile destroys the mining droid, sending a purple cloud of atomised rock into the atmosphere. When the dust settles all that remains of Falcon's Wing is a few small parts of one of the hydraulic legs. You are trapped in time, on Mechanon in 1986 AD with no way of leaving this soulless planet dedicated to the manufacture of hideous weaponry. You have no choice but to go on. Turn to 5.

You follow the android at a distance and it makes for a quiet village. It enters an old building which has a painting hanging outside it of two black horses pulling a four wheeled vehicle made of wood. You follow it inside, cautiously, and the building appears to be an ancient form of recreation centre. There are no vid-booths or massage machines but several men and women appear to be drinking enormous glass mugs of what looks faintly like urine. Some of them appear to be losing control.of their limbs. The android is talking to the man who serves the drinks asking in a flat voice for the use of a phone. You can see no holophones but your attention is momentarily distracted as a man staggers towards you and puts his arm on your shoulder. 'What have we got here then? Going to a fancy dress party?' You search your memory for the vid-lecture which dealt with late 20th century customs and history but all you can remember is that a dress is something worn only by women at this time. You shake your head and reply, mimicking his accent, that you are an extra from a science fiction film. 'A Star Wars chappie eh? Well, come and have a drink.' The android is walking to the back door. Will you:

Ignore the man and follow the android?

Your sword blade jars the Black Knight with a clang and smoke and sparks fly up from its elbow joint. It staggers as if its circuits were overloading. It is certainly no man, but a droid, a mechanical man. It swivels its head towards you and the visor of its great black helmet clicks open. You are ready when a beam of red light lances towards you from the droid's helmet and you dodge it and try to bury the tip of your sword into the gap left by the open visor. Make an Attack Roll.

As your missile arrows down towards the fortress, you can see several small laser cluster banks swivelling to track it. They open fire, but the missile streaks under the red laser lances and slams into the fortress. There is an enormous explosion and the fortress erupts, sending pieces of twisted metal everywhere. The Strike Fighter is blown upward by the force of the blast, but its gyros correct its course and you rush onward through the smoke and debris like a bullet. Turn to 71.

Sweating with the effort inside your battlesuit, you manage to throw off his attempt to take control of your mind, but his mind is as quick as his reflexes and before you can attack him he hurls a blast of mental energy at you.

A small communications droid is linked to a terminal and it disengages and backs away as you approach. You blast it and move over to the terminal. A screen is covered in multi-coloured blocks which flash seemingly at random, but the communica- tions port is still open. You take your Universal Interface and plug it in. Its shape changes to fit the alien specification of the port and it is linked into the communications network in seconds. It probes the databanks, subtly changing the software until it has extracted gygabytes of data on the status of Mechanon. As the Universal Interface completes its work you pick up a radio message.
'Bloodhound calling Lynx, I am in position in front of the hangar door. The inside of the fluorescent building is teeming with battle droids and mobile scanner banks.'

The force field falters and then disappears. You gun the Strike Fighter through the gap but the field is rekindled just as you are half way through. The power surge plays havoc with the Fighter's Ion Drive and CAIN tells you that he must shut down the Drive before it explodes. You have passed through into yet another tunnel at the end of which you Can see the stars of Mechanon's night sky. You are forced to crash land and the Strike Fighter skids for half a mile along the steel floor of the tunnel, throwing you about in your crash-couch harness like a bobsleigh until it comes to a rest. You check the air supply of your battlesuit and then blow the cockpit seals and jump out. There is a whirring noise in the distance and a rail above your head starts to vibrate slightly. You decide to test your jetpack and fly up to the rail. A raildroid looms rapidly larger as it speeds along towards you. You are about to fire your suit's particle disrupter when you see a living being riding on a disc attached to the droid. It slows as it approaches you and you recognise Agidy Yelov. On his own Yelov is a dangerous customer, with all his new toys to help him kill you, you sense that you will do well to survive. The thin atmosphere has been changed to suit the Siriun in this part of the complex and he has no need of a space suit. Yelov recognises you and curses. 'Kill or be killed, Falcon/ he threatens, and lets a small, white object fall from his hand as an Atmospheric Interceptor enters the tunnel in the far distance.

Your plasma blast ionises the gas in a long stream like a ribbon, turning it from yellow to red, but it has passed beneath the wardroid which unleashes a homing missile towards you.

The shock kills you before the homing missile smears your remains over the rocky surface of Thrix.

As you watch the French knights' charge from your position behind the Earl of Northampton, the withering volleys of the English longbowmen take their toll again and again, bringing down ranks of knights and horses as if they had ridden into a wall. Some of the valiant French knights break through and there is fierce hand-to-hand fighting around the Black Prince's position. As you watch, a huge English knight in black armour who bears no coat of arms raises his mace against one of his fellows. The great blow falls and you are engulfed in darkness. One of your ancestors has been slain - it is as if you had never existed. Now Agidy Yelov will rule the Federation.

The surface of Mechanon is wreathed in flames and as you watch a fuel refinery explodes, sending a pillar of flame into the upper atmosphere. The droids are motionless, the space- artillery tubes hang down limply. Mechanon is dead. As the Strike Fighter climbs away from the stricken planet, something happens which you can hardly comprehend, let alone believe. The planet splits into two flaming halves. Its centre has been mined out centuries ago and from the hollowness within flies a ship as large as a mountain. It rumbles skyward on the thrust of a hundred colossal fusion tubes. This must be the planet killer which the computer launched. Its size alone would mean that Earth would be destroyed if it hit a continent at two-tenths the speed of light, but you can tell at a glance that it is a single flying bomb. The planet killer accelerates towards hyper-space speed and CAIN confirms that it is almost certainly on course for Earth. Will you:

As you step through, a worker droid rushes to repair the hole you have made as air starts to whistle out into the tunnel. You have entered a colossal circular room which is crammed with computer banks. Coloured lights flash as fast as the eye can see. Yelov has, unwittingly, led you to the Central Computer. This enormous room is a single computerised brain which controls the whole of the factory planet. You marvel at its size but remembering the complexity of the task it fulfils you are not surprised it throws out enough light to illuminate a small city. Yelov is standing in front of the computer which is the brain of Mechanon, Its tones are very calm and reassuring, but it is saying, There is an organic hostile within my perimeter, Yelov. You assured me that this could never happen. Mechanon is at risk - exterminate the being at once.' Yelov spins to look at you and there is a frown of concentration on his face. He is trying to exert the power of his will over yours. His mind is strong and his will to live burns as hotly as ever. If yours does not, you will lose this battle of wills.

Shutting all other thoughts out you concentrate on exerting your will to control the Black Knight, but there is no will to control inside the menacing suit of armour.

You are too late to halt the descent of the crackling blue mace and Sir Thomas Chandos is bathed in electricity as the force of the blow pulps his helmeted head like an overripe melon. The automaton turns towards you, raising its mace, but suddenly you are engulfed in darkness. Sir Thomas Chandos was your ancestor and he has not yet sired the son whose line comes down to you. Y elov has sent a special droid to kill your ancestor and he has killed you too for it is as if you had never existed.

It takes you some time to find the capsule as it has crashed into a deep wood. When you do, you realise that there is nothing to sabotage, the capsule was designed for a one way trip and could never return to space. Its only purpose was to deliver the android which is now lost in the Devonian night. You return to the road and walk for some miles without locating the android. Suddenly you look up to see several orange streaks in the sky. There is a flash of light and a thunderous roar as a great mushroom cloud of incandescent flame and smoke erupts into the upper atmosphere. The next explosion turns your eyes to steam and strips you to a charred skeleton. The android has swoomne.how provoked a nuclear holocaust on Earth; Yelov has

'Ah, Falcon, I was about to call for you. Agidy Yelov escaped from the detention centre nine minutes ago!'
'But that's impossible ...' you begin, until you realise that you have changed history and this is not the same Earth that you left a few hours ago. While you tell Jobanque where you have been he listens in amazement. By convincing the Danikoi never to build Mechanon you have saved Earth and the Space Federation and now it is as if Mechanon had never existed. Even CAIN's data banks have been changed. You are the only one who will ever really know what might have been. Jobanque believes your story and he compliments you on your success.
'No medals this time, Falcon. We would never convince the Federation that your story is true! Sounds like you've had. quite an exciting time! But rest now, take ten days' vacation. I'll arrange a trip to Titan if you like. I'll have to use another agent to track down Yelov (who never died now, of course!). If you go into the recreation centre ask Sparrowhawk to see me. She may know the workings of a fellow Siriun's mind. Happy holiday, Falcon - use it well.' Barely able to adjust to the fact that a part of your life simply never took place as far an your colleagues are concerned, you walk into the recreation centre in a daze. Bloodhound is leaning close to Sparrowhawk who looks troubled. You ask her to report to Jobanque and, as she leaves, Bloodhound asks you how the test flight went.
'What test flight?' you exclaim, and tell him your incredible story.
You cannot tell whether Bloodhound believes you or not he infuriates you, pretending that you are mad, but at last he says, 'Well, you're as sane as the rest of us. Falcon, and I know you would never lie. But if you were changing history, couldn't you have arranged for me to have a solar-racer while you were at it?'
Ignoring Bloodhound's idiocy you protest, 'I have changed history. Why am I the only one to have memories of Mechanon? CAIN was there too.'
'Sounds like a question for the techs to me,'says Bloodhound 'You're a walking time paradox. Ask Skirrow - if he doesn't know, nobody will!' You shrug your shoulders and decide instead to make the most of your trip to the pleasure-dome on Titan.
