<p>The melee rages around you. The Macedonians fighting with dreadful ferocity are advancing towards Alexander, who is beset by soldiers, backed up against a tree, a ring of dead bodies surrounding him. The townspeople are hesitating before risking a cut from his sword, but the King is obviously tiring. Suddenly your Psychic Awareness tells you that Lord Speke is ahead of you, fighting his way towards Alexander. Turn to 58.</p>
