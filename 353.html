<p>The mechanical packer grabs you. You swing up into the an towards an aluminium cylinder. The machine is apparently going to bottle you, but the cylinder is somewhat smaller than you are and you suppose that both packer and cylinder are stronger than you are. You are held fast, but at the last moment you manage to free your blaster and pull the trigger. The white hot streak of superheated plasma hits the mechanical brain of the packer which seizes up, leaving you dangling helpless in mid- air. The plasma sets fire to the machine and this fire spreads rapidly to a container nearby. To your horror, you see that it is the container holding the vat of serum for the people of Ascension.' Your great-grandfather was born on Ascension. The fire spreads, causing some damage to the Freighter, the delivery of serum will now be delayed by a week. Many thousands will die, including the young woman who is carrying the baby that would have been your great-grandfather. You have never existed. You have failed.</p>
