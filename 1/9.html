<p>Your attack fails and is returned by a mental blast far more powerful than your own. You sink to the ground feeling as if your brain is boiling. Your brain is about to burn out like a faulty electric motor when the Renegade Lord's attention is shifted to Bloodhound who is making an attack of his own, saving your life as he does so. You fall unconscious and your powers of Think- strike will never again be what they were. Subtract one from your ThinkstrikeModifier. When you awake, Bloodhound is coming round, lying next to you. You shake your heads to clear the pain and look up to see that the Imperial Guard are marching to the attack. The Renegade Lord is changing history. You both begin to run up the hillside and the ambulance comes into view a hundred yards away from the Emperor. Turn to 344.</p>
