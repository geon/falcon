<p>Lynx has drawn a knife on Bloodhound and though he is very strong, he is no match for her and is already bleeding badly. They are locked together and you cannot use your blaster, neither can you use your mental powers while wearing the Psionic Damper. You aim a flying kick at Lynx instead but she was ready for you. With the lithe swiftness of a cat Lynx dodges and catches your leg as your boot whistles past her ear. She throws you backwards and you land on your head, breaking the Psionic Damper. Lose 3 Endurance points. Picking yourself up, you try again, as Bloodhound lunges for her knife. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
