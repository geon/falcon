<p>You are acting against the First Law of TIME, but as you step towards the village well, resplendent in your silver uniform with your helmet's reflecting plate pulled down like a mirror in front of your face, the slaughter stops, quite suddenly. They whisper in awe. You point at one of the mongols and Thinkstrike him. He slumps to the ground. Next, you use the mechanical sounding voice box of your Translator to order the mongols to leave the village. Their leader kneels before you and offers homage and the rest follow suit. 'We obey, O spirit of the Everlasting Blue Sky,' he says, and they mount up and ride quickly away. The villagers gaze at you in fear and astonishment. Wasting no time, you gather up the clothes and the nuclear bomb and return to the safety of Falcon's Wing, hoping your actions have not seriously damaged the Timelines. You ask C A I N to what extent you have changed the past, and, to your relief, he responds, 'There is no significant change, Falcon. My files do carry a tale, however, about a sorcerer who saved the village of Ramallo from the mongol Horde, for a little while. Congratulations, Falcon, you are the sorcerer of Ramallo.' Turn to 229.</p>
