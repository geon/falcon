<p>Bloodhound shouts: 'No, Falcon, Thinkstrike!' Too late, you realise you have made a mistake, for the Creche, although reduced in number to five, are masters of mind control. They take you over, and you draw your blaster and kill Bloodhound before he realises what is happening. Staring in horror at what you have done, you feel your hand turning the blaster towards your own head. The last thing you see before you kill yourself is Agidy Yelov stepping from behind the Time Machine of the Creche. Only Lynx is left to defeat him and the Renegade Lord. You have failed.</p>
