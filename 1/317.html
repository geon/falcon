<p>The mental effort makes you lose 4 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you fail to keep them under control. One draws his sword and runs at you, his face a mask of rage, whilst the other rushes to the door and gives the alarm. You release Ogedai, who gasps for air, and turn to meet your attacker. There is no time to draw your blaster, and you must use unarmed combat. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
