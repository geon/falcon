<p>You twist and side-kick the General in the throat, knocking him senseless. The Emperor's guard aims a vicious sword cut at your head, but you duck and, spinning quickly, sweep his legs from under him. He falls to the ground with a clatter of armour and you chop down hard onto the back of his neck with your elbow, and he slumps, unmoving. You move quickly to Ogedai's bedside. Knowing what must be done and hoping to make his death look natural you place a silken cushion over Ogedai's face and press down. His hands scrabble feebly at yours, but he is too weak to resist. Ogedai's face turns purple as he dies. Suddenly, the door swings open and several members of the Imperial Guard rush in and charge at you. You try to dive through the awning to the balcony. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
