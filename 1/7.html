<p>The ambulance trundles on towards Napoleon and you sense that the Renegade Lord is reaching out to control the Emperor's mind. You can no longer see Bloodhound and decide to attack when Napoleon begins to order the Imperial Guard to advance. As you do so, the Renegade Lord becomes aware of you and a wave of mental energy flows into you - your brain goes haywire. You seem to feel hot, cold, rain and fire all at once. It is as if you can see all colours at the same time and myriad voices speak every word in every language you have ever studied. Your brain overheats, literally burning itself out like a faulty electric motor. You are a zombie, incapable of thought, gurgling like a baby. You have failed.</p>
