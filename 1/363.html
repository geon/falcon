				<p>363</p>
<p>Sweating with the effort you place the damper circlet upon your head using your last trace of free-will. The mental attack on your mind is broken and you start moving backwards, accidentally throwing your weightless body into the wall of the bridge. The Phocian, who had turned to stare, is now controlled once more and he will soon be in a position to destroy the envoy's vessel again. You cannot use your mental powers while wearing the Psionic Damper, so you decide to blast him. Turn to 333.</p>
