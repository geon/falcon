<p>The mental effort has made you lose 3 Endurance points, but you manage to keep them under control. You continue until you arc sure Ogedai is dead, and then you order the mongol guards to lead you back through the banqueting hall to the palace gate. In the hall the dancing goes on and you slip unnoticed out into the night. Outside the city gates you tell them to kneel and then knock them out with a couple of deft blows to the neck; before returning to your flyer, amazed at your good fortune at killing the Khan of the mongol horde and living to tell the tale. Turn to 254.</p>
