<p>You roll aside and come up ready to fire your blaster into the ambulance. The Hivers are scurrying backwards out of sight, but you send a bolt of plasma after them. One of them is too slow and it is torched to a frazzle by the white-hot beam. You are getting ready to leap into the ambulance when its front explodes and a flyer accelerates out of it, the Hivers clinging on inside the honeycomb-like seats. The Creche skim low through the smoke of the battlefield, almost faster than the eye can see, making a sonic boom like the explosion of a powder magazine, the ammunition stores for the cannon. As they go you catch the thought that they are heading for the planet Hel. Turn to 161.</p>
