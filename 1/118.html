<p>Your blast of mental energy has overcome Lynx's defences and she slumps to the ground, inert. She comes round quickly. Holding her at blaster point, you open your mind to her as she recovers and she is able to see you are fighting for a just and important cause. She explains that she had been sent by Agidy Yelov to kill or capture you, believing you to be a highly dangerous traitor. You explain the current situation to her and she decides to help you with your mission. Turn to 219.</p>
