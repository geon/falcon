<p>Speke says, 'Discretion is important to an Agent of the Time Police. If you are to prove that you can further the cause of peace within the Space Federation while being vigilant against anyone so diabolical as to tamper with the past, you must learn this quickly.

He is obscured by a cloud of blood as you finally leave. Turn to 22.</p>
