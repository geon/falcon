<p>You step into the small hovrail car, secure the bubble hatch and type in your destination and clearance code as the car rises on its air buffer. The acceleration is steady but not uncomfortable and lasts for half the journey, before you decelerate to the Eiger Vault embarkation point. After many changes of direction, occasionally riding above slower moving cars, you leave the spectacular vista of the neon-clad city behind and plunge into the tunnel to the Eiger. Leaving the monorail you walk to the checkpoint outside the enormous plasteel doors where your ID chip is checked and the mind scanner is used to double-check that you may be allowed into the vault. You step through a small personnel door, past two security droids and into the cavern which houses the Time Machines and the research section of TIME. The area in which the machines are kept is partitioned at intervals and you head straight for your own bay. In the centre of the bay which is lined on three sides with racks carrying maintenance equipment, spare parts, the Variac Drive Re- charger and sundry other useful items, lies Falcon's Wing. You approach the access hatch and the mind scanner lights up red, then green. You are drawn up into the Time Machine by invisible Tractor Beams, activated by CAIN. Soon you are standing on the glowing Access Disc and CAIN chimes, 'Welcome Falcon.' Turn to 210.</p>
