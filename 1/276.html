<p>I he stricken hulk is a sitting duck, your computer is able to target your lasers automatically and you open fire. Twin laser pulses cut through space from your ship to the Phocian's. You can see parts breaking away from the hull in the dazzling red light of your lasers. Suddenly, the scanner screen lights up fiercely; you have scored a direct hit on his Power Plant and the Phocian has been vapourised with his ship. You can only hope that his descendants were not to be shapers of history and that changes in the Timelines will be small. You have, however, saved Korakiik, the Keladi envoy, and thwarted the Renegade Lord.</p>
<p>You turn your ship back to the Starport. As you do so you notice on the rear scanner an asteroid mining ship appear from behind the Asteroid Belt, and your Psychic Awareness registers the presence of a being with great powers of the mind, probably the Renegade Lord. You catch a thought: Golden Horde and then,self destruct. To your surprise the mining ship blossoms into a flowering white light, like a star gone nova, as it explodes. Is the Renegade Lord dead, you wonder? You manage to land the Corsair back at the Starport without too much trouble. Wasting no time, you run to Falcon's Wing before Starport Security come to question you. CAIN tells you that he registered a Variac Drive emission from the centre of the asteroid mining ship, just before it blew up. Whoever it was used their Time Machine to wink out to safety.</p>
<p>Do you have a Thermo-nuclear device? If you do, turn to 415. If you do not, turn to 306.</p>
