<p>A hand-axe, thrown by one of the Imperial Guardsmen strikes the back of your knee and you fall to the floor and are taken. The fate of the Khan's assassin is not a pleasant one. They discuss your punishment which will be to have molten silver poured into your eyes and ears, before you are boiled alive - a death reserved for their respected enemies. You have failed and the Space Federation will never be.</p>
