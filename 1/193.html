<p>Kipping the ambulance doors open reveals a bizarre sight, six features like giant ants, mandibles clicking in agitation, are Kicking into a honeycomb structure, their dull red, compound eyes menacing. The honeycomb is on top of a flyer, similar in design to your own. The six beings, together known as Lord Creche 82282, the Renegade Lord, are unaffected by the combined Thinkstrike. Bloodhound suddenly grabs you and throws you out of the ambulance, leaping down after you and drawing his sabre. He is being controlled by the Creche! A long battle follows during which time you both struggle to find an opening. Although entranced, Bloodhound is a fine swordsman and you begin to bleed heavily from several cuts. Lose 8 Endurance points. If you are still alive, your battle continues and the ambulance rolls on. Nobody intervenes in your fight because Napoleon has given the order for his Imperial Guard to advance and everybody moves off down the hill. At last you break the control over Bloodhound's mind and, dropping his sabre, he mumbles an apology. Turn to 344.</p>
