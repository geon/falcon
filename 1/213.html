<p>Twin laser pulses cut through space from your ship to the Phocian's. You can see parts breaking away from the hull in the dazzling red light of your lasers. Suddenly, the scanner screen lights up fiercely; you have scored a direct hit on his Power Plant and the Phocian has been vapourised with his ship. You can only hope that his descendants were not to be shapers of history and that changes in the Timelines will be small. You have, however, saved Korakiik, the Keladi envoy and thwarted the Renegade Lord. You try to turn your ship back to the Starport but she is badly damaged. Make a Chance Roll.</p>
