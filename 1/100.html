<p>AH you approach the carriage the mind inside senses you and you are locked in a battle of wills. It is a battle which you are hound to lose as the Renegade Lord's mind is stronger than yours. All of your being is taken up with the struggle when, abruptly,the attack ceases. You shake your head dizzily, but it is only the lull before the storm. A wave of mental energy flows intoyou and your brain goes haywire. You seem to feel hot, cold,rain and fire all at once. It is as if you can see all colours at once and myriad voices speak in every language you have ever studied. Your brain overheats, literally burning itself out like a faulty electric motor. You are a zombie, incapable of thought, swayingon your horse and gurgling like a baby. You have failed.</p>
