<p>You are forced backwards against the bulkhead behind you as your blaster discharges a bolt of superheated plasma. The Phocian appears to fuse into his free-fall couch, his body distorting horribly; the forward scanner screen is covered with a red film. You quickly leave the scene and return to your ship. You can only hope that his descendants were not to be shapers of history and that changes in the Timelines will be small. You have, however, saved Korakiik, the Keladi envoy and thwarted the Renegade Lord. You turn your ship back to the Starport. As you do so you notice, on the rear scanner, an asteroid mining ship appear from behind the Asteroid Belt and your Psychic Awareness registers the presence of a being with great power of the mind, probably the Renegade Lord. You catch a thought: Golden Hordes and then, self destruct. To your surprise, the mining ship blossoms into a flowering white light, like a star gone nova, as it explodes. Is the Renegade Lord dead, you wonder? You land safely at the Starport a little while later. Wasting no time, you run to Falcon's Wing before Starport Security come to question you. CAIN tells you that he registered a Variac Drive emission from the centre of the asteroid mining ship just before it blew up. Whoever it was used their Time Machine to wink out to safety. Do you have a nuclear bomb?</p>
<p>If you do, turn to 415. If you do not, turn to 306.</p>
