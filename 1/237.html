<p>A nearby outcrop of rock proves to be a hologram. Lord Speke or another traveller in time is here. You walk through the hologram and see a Model B Time Machine, that of one of the human or humanoid Lords of TIME. From the markings you guess it to be that of Lord Speke and, surprisingly, he has left the Access Hatch on automatic, an extraordinarily careless mistake. You are drawn up into the machine and come to rest on the Access Disc. Lord Speke, dressed as a Macedonian soldier, is sitting in his crash couch, examining a Macedonian sword of unusually fine craftsmanship. He has not noticed you. The floor of his machine is strewn with maps, charts and texts in the languages of the period. There is a beautiful wooden display cabinet full of ancient Greek weapons, including a fine collection of swords which appear to be originals, showing no sign of age, as if they had been cast quite recently. His Molecular Converter has not been used recently, despite Speke's clothes. Then he looks up and sees you. You remove your helmet and he recognises you.</p>
<p>'Falcon, you have caught me in the act,' he says despondently. He says he will give himself up and he explains that for some time he has been breaking the First Law of TIME and living as an ancient Greek. He has always been careful not to upset the Timelines seriously, but he knows he has been acting wrongly. His collection of ancient Greek weapons is authentic and he has even buried ancient artifacts in places where he could 'discover' them as archaeological finds in the 31st century. You look into his mind, with his consent, and see that it is all true - Speke is not the Renegade Lord. Tears run down his face as he realises his hobby is over. 'At least,' he says, 'I can say I saw the man whose people thought he was a god.' He asks you how you discovered him and you tell him about your mission. He is shocked by the news of a traitor Lord but offers a few words of advice. 'It is not likely to be either Pilota, or myself - we are both Earther stock and interference with Earth's past might mean that we had never existed!' You thank Speke, but feel obliged to order him to return to 3033 AD and give himself up. Downcast, he assents. You leave and return to Falcon's Wing to continue with your mission. Have you spoken with Special Agent Bloodhound since your mission began? If you have, turn to 338. If you have not, turn to 52.</p>
