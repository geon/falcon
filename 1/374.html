<p>Falcon's Wing rematerialises at the edge of a forest near hills. It is dark outside but you can see the lights of thousands of camp fires. Switching the camera to night vision you make out an enormous army of mongols, their horses tethered near them, outside a large town. There is a river running through the town. You ask CAIN for historical data. Before CAIN responds, blackness engulfs you suddenly. Someone has changed the Timelines and one of your ancestors has been killed before his time. It is as if you had never existed. You have failed.</p>
