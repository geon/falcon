<p>You drop into the long grass beside the ambulance and the Hornet drops down towards you, shattering as it hits the side of the ambulance, which you placed between it and yourself. Unfortunately, it does not explode and damage the ambulance, perhaps because its microcomputer registers the fact that it has not found its target. Bloodhound moves in to attack Lynx hand- to-hand, as she closes in on you and at the same moment you sense that the Renegade Lord is reaching out to control the Emperor's mind, realising that using your mental powers will give your position away, will you:</p>
