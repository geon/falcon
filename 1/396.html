<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A brilliant scientist, Speke, partly due to his mental powers, was one of two men largely responsible for the invention of the Time Machine. Like many brilliant men, he is eccentric, will not suffer fools gladly and is prone to break off a conversation suddenly, lost in thought. He is a brave man and, with Irving Klimt, undertook the first ever voyage into the past, starting from 2974. They undertook several journeys together, but Klimt never returned from an investigation of classical Greece in the time of Philip of Macedon. Lord Speke has always maintained that he was killed in a drunken brawl, by a soldier, though Klimt had always been careful not to change the past by becoming involved. With the setting up of TIME Speke was the obvious choice for appointment as the Earther Lord and he has enjoyed his position ever since. He is also well known for pioneering work on the mental attack of Thinkstrike, with which he is adept. He is also Professor of Earth Archaeology at the Academy where his specialist subject is Alexander the Great.</p>
<h2>Homeworld</h2>
<p>Earth. Population: 43.997 billion.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic History</h2>
