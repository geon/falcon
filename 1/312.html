<p>Since the Phocian is not in control of his own mind he is defenceless against your Thinkstrike and he starts to float unconscious, in his free-fall harness. You free him from the couch and tie him up with the harness before pushing his weightless body back into your ship. By the time he comes round you are on your way back to the starport. As you head back you notice, on the rear scanner, an asteroid mining ship appear from behind the Asteroid Belt, and your Psychic Awareness registers the presence of a being with great powers of the mind, probably the Renegade Lord. You catch a thought: Golden Horde and then, self destruct. To your surprise the mining ship blossoms into a flowering white light, like a star gone nova, as it explodes. Is the Renegade Lord dead, you wonder? Then you notice the Phocian coming round and you interrogate him. Your voice is mechanical, using the Universal Translator, and he readily informs you that his mind was taken over by a very alien and powerful mind, obviously neither Keladi, Phocian nor Earther. He had been instructed to destroy the envoy's vessel. He asks what is happening, but following the First Law of TIME, you ignore him.</p>
<p>You land safely and leave the pirate Phocian tied up in the ship. Wasting no time, you run to Falcon's Wing before Starport Security come to question you. CAIN tells you that he registered a Variac Drive emission from the centre of the asteroid mining ship just before it blew up. Whoever it was used their Time Machine to wink out to safety. CAIN informs you that you have made history here, but that his memory banks remain essentially unchanged. Do you have a nuclear bomb? If you do, turn to 415. If you do not, turn to 306.</p>
