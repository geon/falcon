<p>A lancing white bolt of superheated plasma strikes the cydroid which short-circuits in a flood of sparks and pitches forward, inert. A nearby Plasma Sensor begins to flash, signalling Citpol Enforcers, the civil police. A blue and gold Citpol jetcopter lands nearby as you examine the charred remains of the cydroid, but the damage is too severe for you to gain a clue as to its origins. Two Enforcers alight from their 'copter, pointing their stun- lances at you. 'Let's see your ID.' You produce your ID chip and hand it to the one who spoke, still covered by the other. He clips it into his Remote Access Terminal (RAT) on his arm and a look of disappointment crosses his features, as he realises who you are. 'What's been going on here?' he says. You report exactly what happened and he returns your chip and turns to examine the cydroid. Turn to 137.</p>
