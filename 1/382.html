<p>Realising that time travel would be invented too early if Kirik's machine was discovered, you manually set the Variac Drive to engage in a minute's time and pause on your way out only to pick up Kirik's Psionic Enhancer. The machine winks out into null-space and it will never reappear, but at least you have preserved the Timeline. The Psionic Enhancer carries a chip developed on the Kelados Research Station for Lord Kirik. You may slip this into your helmet for it increases the power of Thinkstrike. Add one to your Thinkstrike Modifier. Turn to 262.</p>
