<p>You roll onto the balcony as a hand-axe, thrown by one of the Imperial Guard, tangles itself in the silken awning behind you. You leap from the balcony to the edge of the palace roof, twinging by your arms and pulling your legs up over the edge as the guardsmen rush onto the balcony. You run to your flyer. Some of the mongols, shouting ferociously, will be upon you before you can climb aboard. Balancing on the edge of the roof and mentally exhausted, you are forced to use your blaster. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
