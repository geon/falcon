<p>Ripping the ambulance doors open reveals a bizarre sight - six creatures like giant ants, mandibles clicking in agitation, are backing into a honeycomb structure, their dull, red, compound eyes menacing. The honeycomb is on top of a flyer, similar in design to your own. The six beings, together known as Lord Creche 82282, the Renegade Lord, are unaffected by the combined Power of Will attack. Bloodhound suddenly grabs you and throws you out of the ambulance, leaping down after you and picking up a fallen musket. He is being controlled by the Creche! He aims a savage swipe with his musket. Turn to 38.</p>
