<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lord Creche 82282 is a group awareness, composed of six Hivers, These beings pool their minds in order to become a living computer. They have no personality as an Earther would describe it, but in common with all Hivers, would sacrifice themselves for the sake of the Hive, without hesitation. They are properly described as 'it', thinking and acting as one. Response to any question takes a few seconds as each inputs data before there is any reaction. The Hivers pioneered the Federation's studies of powers of the mind, inventing the Psionic Enhancer. They are thought to have developed mental powers beyond that of any other race.</p>
<h2>Homeworld</h2>
<p>The Hive. A dry, hot world, its surface dotted with cities resembling gigantic termite nests. Population (estimated): greater than 200 billion. Hiver factory workers are extremely hard working. The first to acquire weapons on their world, they eradicated all other intelligent species.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic History</h2>
<p>The Hivers were intent on conquering other worlds at the same time that Earth was building the Space Federation. They were heavily defeated in the Space War of 2934 and joined the Space Federation in the following year. They have cooperated since that date and have traded the life-prolonging drugs which give Earthers a lifespan of 250 years in return for metals.</p>
