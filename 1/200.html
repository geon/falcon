<p>You wait outside, pretending to be wounded as the clamour inside the city increases. New siege ladders are brought up and a phalanx of men smashes through the city gates. Soon the clash of arms gives way to the screams of the townspeople as the Macedonians massacre them in the frenzy that has seized them when Alexander was lost to sight. Minutes later, Alexander, badly wounded, is carried by several soldiers from the gate to his great white tent. Your Psychic Awareness tells you that one of the nearby soldiers is Lord Speke, and he has also noticed you. He pauses, then approaches you. He is carrying a sword but he gives himself up.</p>
<p>You walk up into the hills, and he explains that for some time he has been breaking the First Law of TIME and living as an ancient Greek. He has always been careful not to upset the Timelines seriously, but he knows he has been acting wrongly. His collection of ancient Greek weapons in his Time Machine is authentic and he has even buried ancient artifacts in places where he could 'discover' them as archeological finds in the 31st century. You look into his mind, with his consent, and see that it is all true - Speke is not the Renegade Lord. Tears run down his face as he realises his hobby is over. 'At least,' he says, 'I can say I saw the man whose people thought he was a god.' He asks you how you discovered him and you tell him about your mission. He is shocked by the news of a traitor Lord but offers a few words of advice. 'It is not likely to be either Pilota, or myself - we are both Earther stock and interference with Earth's past might mean that we had never existed.' You thank Speke, but feel obliged to order him to return to 3033 AD and give himself up. Downcast, he assents and returns to his. Time Machine while you continue with your mission. Turn to 272.</p>
