<p>As you are drawn up into Falcon's Wing you are suddenly engulfed in blackness. Then you find yourself in a smoke-filled shelter, a fugitive from an alien race on your own world. The past has been changed and your memories with it. You leap out of the shelter to hurl a grenade at a strange alien craft on the street above you ... As Falcon, Agent of TIME, you have failed.</p>
