<p>You throw yourself behind a plasteel container and the Particle Disruptor dissolves part of a nearby stanchion with a fizzing sound. This cydroid is apparently a very advanced model. You hear the siren wail of an approaching Citpol jetcopter. The cydroid makes a superhuman leap to the edge of the loading bay and drops fifty feet to the level below, cracking the streetmetal on impact. Unaffected by the cloud of sparks this causes, it disappears into the maze of the city's traffic lanes. You are on your feet in time to greet the two Enforcers who alight from the jetcopter. There are always two of the City Police, and they both cover you with their stun-lances. 'Let's see your ID.' You produce your ID chip and hand it to the one who spoke, still covered by the other. He clips it into the Remote Access Terminal (RAT) on his arm and a look of disappointment crosses his features as he sees you are a genuine SAT. 'Fun and games on your first day, eh? What have you to say for yourself?' You report exactly what happened and the Enforcer hands back your ID chip, saying, 'A file of your statement will be flashed to your Section Chief.' With that they turn on their heels and take off, bathing you with the hot exhaust of their 'copter as they go. Turn to 169.</p>
