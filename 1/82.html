<p>For three hours you circle the hill near Shevardino on which Napoleon's Command Post is set up, but there is no sign of the Renegade Lord. At one time, Napoleon is forced to receive the attentions of an Army surgeon and you overhear a rumour that he may have had a minor stroke. He recovers, however, and you continue your vigil. Bloodhound looks at you and motions you to concentrate - soon you can feel a presence approaching, a very strong mental presence. Your heads turn as one towards a strange contraption coming nearer Napoleon and his escort. Two horses, one behind the other, are harnessed to a wooden, covered wagon with two small holes high up on either side for windows and doors which open at the back. A medical orderly is riding the first of the horses. It is one of the first ambulances ever made of the pattern designed by Baron Larrey, a French Army Surgeon, in 1805. The strength of the mental presence within the ambulance leads you to believe that the Renegade Lord must be inside, and you prepare to attack together. Turn to 53.</p>
