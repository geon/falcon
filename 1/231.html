<p>You manage to turn the stricken ship back towards the Starport. As you do so you notice on the rear scanner an asteroid mining ship appear from behind the Asteroid Belt, and your Psychic Awareness registers the presence of a being with great powers of the mind, probably the Renegade Lord. You catch a thought, Golden Horde and then, self destruct. To your surprise the mining ship blossoms into a flowering white light, like a star gone nova, as it explodes. Is the Renegade Lord dead, you wonder? It takes all of your skill to land the under-powered Corsair ship which groans and shudders during re-entry but, thankfully, gains the safety of the Starport, after a very hard landing. Wasting no time, you run to Falcon's Wing before Starport Security come to question you. CAIN tells you that he registered a Variac Drive emission from the centre of the asteroid mining ship just before it blew up. Whoever it was used their Time Machine to wink out to safety. Do you have a nuclear bomb? If you do, turn to 415. If you do not, turn to 306.</p>
