<p>You set your two controlled mongols against the Imperial Guardsman and the general who cry the alarm. You take advantage of the battle to slip through the door and into the room beyond.</p>
<p>Inside is a bedchamber, and sitting on a large litter, swaddled in silks and furs, is Ogedai Khan, still weak from his illness. He looks up, his narrow eyes questioning your purpose. Golden statues, chests of treasure and tapestries line the walls. Silk awnings close off the balcony at the back of the room. You sense that your controlled guards will soon be defeated. You do not have much time. Knowing what must be done and hoping to make his death seem natural, you place a silken cushion over Ogedai's face and press down. His hands scrabble feebly at yours, but he is too weak to resist. His face turns blue as he dies. Suddenly the door swings open and several members of the Imperial Guard run in and charge at you. You try to dive through the awning to the balcony. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
