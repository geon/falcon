<p>You wheel your horse about and wishing Bloodhound ban chance head back towards the battle line. You veer right, deciding to begin near Poniatowski and then work your way along to the great redoubt. You crouch low as a cannon ball whistles overhead, bouncing along for three hundred yards before coming to rest against a tree-stump. Every now and then you see a small gap appear in the French columns where a cannon ball has mown down as many as ten men, before losing momentum. But each time they close ranks and charge on. You are approaching Poniatowski's wing when suddenly your Psychic Awareness tells you that a being with mental powers is nearby. Turn to 73.</p>
