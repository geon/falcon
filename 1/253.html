<p>You bank and dive as twin laser pulses from the Phocian flash past your ship into the blackness of space. Then the Phocian increases speed. A third, larger ship appears on the Scanner beyond an Asteroid Belt, and the Corsair "changes course to intercept. You match course and increase speed as a second message reaches you, this time from the larger ship. This is the Clanship Keladan III; we are on a priority diplomatic mission. Do not attack. Repeat, do not attack. Change course. We are Keladi, do not attack.' You realise that this is the envoy ship carrying Korakiik, and that they will soon be within the attack range of the Phocian Corsair. You try desperately to target your lasers for another shot. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
