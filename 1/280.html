<p>Using your power of Psychic Awareness, you reach out telepathically to the mind of Silvermane. His current train of thought is one of curiosity about you, but this changes to surprise as he realises that you are probing his mind. He thinks a message to you, the tone of which is condescending but tolerant: You are exceeding your authority - I don't mind but others would and you realise he is thinking of Kirik. I suggest you cease this probing of my mind immediately. You decide to break off mind contact. Do you:</p>

		<table>
			
						<tr>
							<td>Go on to contact Kirik?</td>
							<td><a href="209.html">Turn to 209</a></td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Give a short speech of thanks to conclude the ceremony?</td>
							<td><a href="167.html">Turn to 167</a></td>
						</tr>
		</table>
