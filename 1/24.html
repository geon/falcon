<p><b>[Score a K]</b></p>
<p>Clone's mind is a maze of violent and selfish impulses, easily controlled. You make him call off his gang and in amazement they goggle as you force Clone to let you climb up behind him. 'But Machine is dead,' cries one of the women.</p>
<p>Before they can protest further Clone whisks you away to the edge of Old Geneva and you relinquish control of his mind as you step onto the pedway once more.'I'll get you for this, mutie mind-scrambler, they'll never follow me now, I'll remember you...' He is still raving as you near the hovrail embarkation point. Turn to 169.</p>
