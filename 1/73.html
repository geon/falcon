<p>While you dismount and look around, trying to locate the source of the mental powers which you sense, an infantry battalion passes you, marching to the attack. You are within a hundred yards of Marshal Poniatowski and his staff when the battalion's drummer boy, in the rear rank, stops drumming and turns towards you. You look at him suspiciously as he frowns in your direction. Before you can look into his mind you realise that he is attacking you with a blast of mental power, a Thinkstrike! You were half ready for this and you put up a mental barrier. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
