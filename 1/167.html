<p>You thank the Lords of TIME for attending your Graduation Ceremony, saying that you will repay their trust in you many times over. Lord Speke thanks you on behalf of the Lords of TIME and exhorts you to further the cause of harmony within the Space Federation while being vigilant against anyone so diabolical as to tamper with the past. After his speech you salute and are just leaving when Lord Kirik grabs one of the small seal-like creatures in his tank and thrusts it into his mouth with voracious ferocity. He is obscured by a cloud of blood as you finally leave. Turn to 22.</p>
