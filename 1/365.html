<p>The horse dies and its rider is pitched headlong onto the turf. Bloodhound and Lynx Thinkstrike two more. The remaining lancer catches Lynx in the shoulder but she grabs the lance and swings herself up on it, kicking the lancer in the face. He tumbles, unconscious, from the saddle, but she falls beside him. She is badly wounded and has to return to her Autodoc. She urges you to go on saying, 'I'll see you at the Eiger Vault Rec Centre,' and wishes you luck before she limps away. You run to catch up the ambulance. Turn to 251.</p>
