<p>The crackling bolt of lightning from your blaster pierces through the hussar's body and he falls back into the brook with a splash. You are turning to ride out of the hollow when all goes black around you. You have killed your ancestor and neither you, your father, nor your father's father have ever existed. You have changed the course of history and failed in your mission.</p>
