<p>Lord Speke's mind falls under your control. You hold him there as Alexander, exhausted, drops his sword again. Some of his men arrive in time to defend him. Within moments, the tide of battle is turned completely and the Macedonians, driven wild by the danger to their king, begin to massacre the townspeople. Alexander is borne away by several soldiers to be tended by the doctors in his tent. When the danger is past and the battle moved on, you take Lord Speke up to the hills. Looking into his mind you see that he has been breaking the First Law of TIME and living as an ancient Greek. He has always been careful not to upset the timelines seriously, but he knows he has been acting wrongly. His collection of ancient Greek weapons in his Time Machine is authentic and he has even buried ancient artifacts in places where he could 'discover' them as archaeological finds in the 31st century. Speke is not the Renegade Lord, and you release him from your control. Tears run down his face as he realises his hobby is over. 'At least', he says, 'I can say I saw the man whose people thought he was a god.' He asks you how you discovered him and you tell him about your mission. He is shocked by the news of a traitor Lord but offers a few words of advice: 'It is not likely to be either Pilota, or myself -we are both Earther stock and interference with Earth's past might mean that we had never existed.' You thank Speke but feel obliged to order him to return to 3033 AD and give himself up. Downcast, he agrees and returns to his Time Machine while you continue with your mission. Turn to 272.</p>
