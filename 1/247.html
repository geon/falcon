<p>At the top of the stairs is a landing leading to a door with gold panels. A blackened staff with a tuft of horsehair hanging down from its top has been driven into the floor before it. A member of the Imperial Guard, dressed immaculately in gold and black lacquered armour is talking to an older man he refers to as 'Noyan' or general, who wears the long wraparound cloak of leather lined with fur, called a del, that the mongols wear when not at war or if they cannot afford armour. You guess that this must be Ogedai's room, as the balcony must be just beyond it. You decide to Thinkstrike them both in quick succession. Make a Thinkstrike Roll.</p>
