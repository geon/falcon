<p>Twin laser pulses dart from your ship but your aim was off. They miss the Phocian ship and are lost in blackest space. As you lock on for a second shot you see your target darting and weaving. He is a skilful pilot, used to combat in these craft and he will soon have you in his laser's sights. You decide to take evasive action. Make an Evasion Roll, but count your Evasion Modifier as 0 for this roll only.</p>
