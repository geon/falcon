<p>You follow several Macedonians up the ladder. They manage to clear a way and you reach the top of the wall as the screams of the dying begin. Below you a few Greeks and Persians are forcing their way through the townspeople towards Alexander, dealing death with the skilled precision of battle-hardened veterans. Before you can jump down an archer in one of the towers lets loose an arrow. Your Psychic Awareness warns you Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
