<p>If you wish to do so you may use CAIN to look at the files on each of the Lords of TIME. Each file has a number corresponding to a paragraph in this book. You should note these down in the boxes provided on your Agent Profile. You may turn to these whenever you are in your Time Machine, but alwaysnote the number of the paragraph you are already at, as no paragraph numbers to turn to will be given in the files. The file paragraph numbers are as follows:</p>

		<table>
			
						<tr>
							<td>Lord Speke</td>
							<td><a href="396.html">Turn to 396</a></td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Lord Silvermane</td>
							<td><a href="399.html">Turn to 399</a></td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Lord Kirik</td>
							<td><a href="395.html">Turn to 395</a></td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Lord Creche 82282:</td>
							<td><a href="398.html">Turn to 398</a></td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Lord Pilota</td>
							<td><a href="397.html">Turn to 397</a></td>
						</tr>
		</table>
	
<p>When you are ready you may either:</p>

		<table>
			
						<tr>
							<td>Ask CAIN the current whereabouts of the Lords of TIME</td>
							<td><a href="295.html">Turn to 295</a></td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Ask if there have been any expeditions into the past since the death of Agent Q</td>
							<td><a href="307.html">Turn to 307</a></td>
						</tr>
		</table>
