<p>You sense that your Thinkstrike has succeeded but still the mental power exists inside the ambulance, confirming that the Renegade Lord is the Creche, the six Hiver beings that form one mind. You have knocked out one of them, weakening their power but they Thinkstrike back at you and you are unable to withstand the force of the mental blast even though it must be weakened. You sink unconscious to the ground. When you awake Bloodhound is lying next to you. You shake your heads to clear the pain and look up to see that the Imperial Guard are marching to the attack. The Renegade Lord is changing history. You both begin to run up the hillside and the ambulance comes into view a hundred yards away from the Emperor. Turn to 344.</p>
