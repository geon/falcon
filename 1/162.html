<p>A lancing white bolt of superheated plasma shatters a floodlight behind your target. You have missed. A Plasma Sensor flashes blue indicating that Citpol, the civil police, have been alerted. As you take aim again the cydroid points at you with his arm. The hand snaps upwards revealing a small nozzle which protrudes from its wrist. The red pulse of a Particle Disruptor streaks towards you. You have an instant to react, make an Evasion Roll.</p>
