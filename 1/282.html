<p>There is nothing you can do as the Renegade Lord's mind bends its full power against you. A wave of mental energy flows into you and your brain goes haywire. You seem to feel heat, cold, rain and fire all at once. It is as if you can see all colours at once and myriad voices speak in every language you have ever studied. Your brain overheats, literally burning itself out like a faulty electric motor. You are a zombie, incapable of thought, gurgling like a baby. You have failed.</p>
