<p>You use your power of Psychic Awareness to enter the communal mind of the Creche. Their alien thought patterns are disturbing but your initial impression is one of group harmony. They think a message back to you which seems devoid of emotion: We note your thought probe. Under TIME regulations you arc beyond the parameters of permitted activity. We must inform the other Lords, those who are not we, myself. Their mandibles click and via your Universal Translator you understand that they are informing the other Lords that you have tried to read their minds. Lord Pilota smothers a smile, but the waters of Kirik's tank boil as his pincers thresh angrily. Silvermane shakes his head in seeming disappointment whilst Speke shouts angrily, 'How dare you? You are risking an interstellar incident.' Turn to 194.</p>
