<p>'Where are the Lords of TIME at this moment?' you ask CAIN. Your computer chooses a visual display for this information from the files of the Service Computer.</p>
<p>TIME NOW 12.41</p>

<p>CAIN says, 'It is unusual that access to this kind of information should be denied to your level of security clearance. I have taken the precaution of linking with the service computer and I can tell you that Lord Kirik entered the Eiger Vault and left in his Time Machine. Lord Silvermane has just arrived here - at 12.40 - as have two others with Omega security clearance - at 12.33 and 12.37. Only Lords have this code. The conclusion must be obvious, even to a human, Falcon.' You decide to act on CAIN's information after telling him to shut up, and hurry out to meet the recent arrivals. Turn to 349.</p>
