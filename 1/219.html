<p>You describe the situation to Lynx and tell her that Bloodhound had also been sent by Yelov to kill you and that he is now watching over Napoleon at the hamlet of Shevardino. Your horse has been frightened away and you set out on foot to explore the battle line nearer the redoubts. As you approach, bugles sound behind you and a great charge of French infantry is launched with Marshal Ney at their head. The Frenchmen, singing the Marseillaise, come on shoulder to shoulder, magnificent in their blue and white uniforms. You are swept up in the charge and carried forward, unable to do anything against the hundreds of men, exhilarated in the heat of battle. On the redoubt ahead of you, the Russian commander, Prince Bagration, rides out in front of his line of green-jacketed men and salutes the French columns, crying in French, 'Bravo, messieurs, c'est superbe!' As you approach Bagration's men they unleash a hail of musket fire and you take this opportunity to throw yourself to the ground as if dead, and let the charge pass over you.</p>
<p>Afterwards, battered and muddied, you pick yourselves up. You have found no trace of the Renegade Lord and Lynx suggests you return to Napoleon's Command Post at Shevardino in case Bloodhound needs help. You agree and after a short time lost in the fog of battle, you approach the Emperor and his staff. Bloodhound rides to greet you and you tell him what has passed between you and Lynx. Turn to 183.</p>
