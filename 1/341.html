<p>You order the guards to slit Ogedai's throat. He is too weak to resist but, faced with the prospect of murdering their Khan, their wills revolt against yours and your control is thrown off. One of the guards draws his sword and runs at you, his face a mask of rage, whilst the other rushes to the door and gives the alarm. You turn to meet your attacker. There is no time to draw your blaster, and you must use unarmed combat. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
