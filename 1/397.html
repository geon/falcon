<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Set apart by her mental powers, Pilota accepted her position as a Lord of TIME only when a gift of a solar-sail racer was offered if she agreed. She is highly intelligent, but seems not to take her responsible position as a Lord very seriously. She still seldom misses a race and is highly successful in the sport of solar-sailing which takes the courage to make a close approach to the sun and the fine judgement not to go too close. Before joining TIME, Pilota had been on the official list of space smugglers and was found not guilty of tax evasion after an investigation by the Lastlanding authorities. She prefers low-gravity environments similar to those on Lastlanding.</p>
<h2>Homeworld</h2>
<p>Lastlanding. Found accidentally in 2571 when the colony ship, Utopia, crash landed on a hospitable, but low-gravity planet. It was the first outer colony. It now has a population of 0.808 billion and still attracts immigrants from Earth. It is a world of golden opportunities and great space, where it is still possible to buy unused land. Each citizen can vote on all issues via holophone in the comfort of their own home. The police force are not kept busy, but Lastlanding has become a bolt hole for those on the run, throughout the Federation.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic History</h2>
<p>Lastlanding was a founder member of the Space Federation and increases in importance. As it does so, however, its dependence on Earth dwindles. They now control their own policy towards other worlds.</p>
