<p>Your blaster emits its lightning bolt of white-hot plasma and Bloodhound dies. Suddenly, you feel the attack of the Renegade Lord, concentrating everything in a Thinkstrike against you. A wave of mental energy flows into you and your brain goes haywire. You seem to feel hot, cold, rain and fire all at once. It is as if you can see all colours at once and myriad voices speak every word in every language you have ever studied. Your brain overheats, literally burning itself out like a faulty electric motor. You are a zombie, incapable of thought, swaying on your horse and gurgling like a baby. You have failed.</p>
