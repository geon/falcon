<p>Pilota responds, her voice high-pitched in the thin air, 'I noticed yesterday that someone has spent much time researching the history of Earth around the Timehole of 1241 AD. A very great deal of time, according to the Central Library Log. I suggest you make it your first mission to investigate that Timehole, just in case someone is doing something they shouldn't be. I know that there isn't much to go on here; call it a hunch if you like, but I would appreciate it if you would move quickly and check that all is well.'</p>
<p>You decide to keep your real mission secret and return to Earth for further information. Saluting Pilota and taking your leave, you are back at the console of your Time Machine within thirty minutes. CAIN confirms that what Pilota says about the library is true and that Pilota herself is not the one who has researched this part of Earth history.</p>
<p>If you have seen a man in golden armour called Iskander, turn to 114. If you have seen a Phocian pirate, turn to 34.</p>
<p>If you have seen neither of these, will you:</p>
