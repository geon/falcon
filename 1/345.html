<p>You throw yourself into the mud and fire your blaster at the giant crocodile which is lunging at you. In your haste you hit only its leg and the monster's jaws have closed around you before the sensation of pain reaches its sluggish brain. Powerless to resist, you are pulled below the surface of the swamp, threshing madly. Your ribs crack and you are soon too weak to struggle, drowned in the primeval swamp. You have failed.</p>
