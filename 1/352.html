<p>Lynx crouches, cat-like, and grabs your leg as your boot flashes past her shoulder. She heaves upward and you fall backwards, heavily. Bloodhound attacks her again, but she is able to hold you off for some time. Eventually you overcome Lynx, but not before she gashes your hip with her knife. Lose 5 Endurance points If you are still alive, you take stock of your surroundings. Lynx is out cold and while you were struggling, everybody has moved down the hill towards the battle line. The Imperial Guard are marching to the attack and the ambulance, too, is trundling away down the hill. Napoleon has ordered the attack and the Renegade Lord has changed the past. Turn to 344.</p>
