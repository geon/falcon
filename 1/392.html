<p>Somehow you have only managed to hit the Phocian in the shoulder. His shoulder disappears in a hiss of reddish vapour and his arm rotates gently away from his body surrounded by a cloud of small red globules. Such is the power, however, of the alien mind which controls him that he still fires his ship's lasers, piercing the hull of the envoy ship. There is a brilliant white explosion which fills the scanner screen and then you are suddenly engulfed in blackness. Then you find yourself in a smoke-filled shelter, a fugitive from an alien race on your own world. The past has been changed and your memories with it. You leap out of the shelter to hurl a grenade at a strange alien craft on the street above you... As Falcon, Agent of TIME, you have failed.</p>
