<p>With the lightning reactions and skill of a trained combateer you draw your blaster and fire, just as Yelov was preparing in blast you. You hit him and he is thrown backwards, one arm and leg burnt horribly. He falls down through a gap in the tree carpet and you run to the hole and peer down. His body is pillowed on an eerily glowing mass of jelly, like a giant amoeba As you watch he moves feebly and rolls off onto the leaf mould that covers the ground. As you peer through the hole the darkness below is lit by a faint blue light. Something much larger than Yelov is slithering slowly towards him. Yelov cannot move! Bloodhound cuts a rope from the creepers and you blast the fungoid mass that is moving towards him. It shudders and retracts and Bloodhound risks his life going down to save Yelov He ties him up and you both haul him up to the tree carpet. You carry him to Falcon's Wing and, placing him in the Autodoc, sedate him heavily, before returning to the Eiger Vault. Turn to 420.</p>
