<p>You dismount and walk towards the new mental presence, looking carefully about you. Suddenly a drummer boy who had been wandering forlornly up the hillside turns to you and speaks. To your surprise it is a woman's voice - that of Lynx, a Special Agent of TIME, like Bloodhound and yourself. The disguise is perfect - her boyish features are smeared with mud from the battlefield. 'Falcon, Bloodhound, I have a Termination Order for you both from our leader, Agidy Yelov.' With that, she unleashes a Hornet, a miniature guided missile, like an arrow with wings, which jets towards you. Do you:</p>

							<td>Run behind the ambulance which is drawing near?</td>
							<td><a href="80.html">Turn to 80</a></td>
