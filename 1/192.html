<p>Acting with the instincts of a trained combateer, you throw yourself through the air, roll, and come up in a shooting position on one knee, both hands steadying your blaster. A translucent beamof ruby light connects the tip of the laser rifle to the wall of the bay, behind your shoulder, severing a camera from its gymbals,and the Eiger Vault energy weapon siren begins to wail. You open fire. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
