<p>Lynx's mental defences are too strong and she has the time since flinging herself behind the dead horse well. You notice the muzzle of the Master resting on the ground, under the horse's broken neck, just as a white bolt of plasma erupt* from it. You are hurled backwards through the air, dead before you hit the ground. Lynx has fulfilled her mission and you have failed.</p>
