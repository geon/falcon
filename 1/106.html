<p>The outside camera begins to swivel, showing you the land all around. Behind you is a forest, shrouded in snow, and the Hologram Generator disguises Falcon's Wing as part of this forest. You are on high ground and to the right you can see a village with a pall of smoke rising above it. Outside the village is a mound of bodies, each missing both ears. The mongols have been busy. Ahead, the frosted ground falls away into a wide river valley. The river is frozen over but you can plainly see its graceful curves stretching to a walled city a few miles away. Here and there on the plain you can see parties of horsemen riding swiftly. You ask CAIN for some historical information. CAIN responds. 'It is winter, 1241 AD. The city you see is Vienna and the river, the Danube. The mongol horde led by the general, Subatai, has conquered Russia and Poland, and defeated a western army at Liegnitz, before overrunning Hungary. They are a few miles from Vienna, poised to ravage the rest of Europe. Their ruler is Ogedai, son of Genghis Khan. He will die within the next few days and when the news reaches the Golden Horde, they must, under Genghis Khan's code of law, the Yasa, return to the mongol capital, Karakorum, to decide who will succeed him. Vienna will not fall and Europe will be saved.'</p>
<p>You break in, 'And if Ogedai should live?'</p>
<p>CAIN continues, The likelihood is that Europe would be overrun and the timelines changed beyond recognition. Civilisation would be set back a thousand years.'</p>
<p>As you reach for your holo-detector, a black disc-like shape crosses your path of vision, streaking skyward with a sound like a thunderclap. CAIN chimes, 'A small Ion Drive craft, probably a flyer, has taken off nearby.' You ask for an estimate of its destination and CAIN responds, 'I estimate China. The mongol capital, Karakorum, is in China, Falcon.' Do you:</p>
