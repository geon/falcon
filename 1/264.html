<p>Falcon's Wing reaches the surface and bobs gently. Your external camera revolves slowly until a floating platform comes into sight. A hideous apparition of jointed legs and bloated brain sacs slithers over its edge and is lost to the deep. Your exterior microphone amplifies a strange clicking which your Translator reads as, '... unforgivable interruption of Kelcrrrrck'ick by a non-clan member...' Apparently there is no universal equivalent for Kelcrrrrck'ick. Puzzling as to what you may have Interrupted your attention is suddenly drawn to the screen as the camera tilts down towards the surface, picking up some movement. Through the reflected glare of the Keladi sun you see what looks like a hundred-metre long sea monster with six luminous eyes about to engulf you.</p>
<p>Falcon's Wing lurches violently as it erupts from the water and you realise it is a Keladi space boat with its floodlights on, a rakish space ship shaped like a manta ray. CAIN chimes, They are requesting holophone contact,' and you open a channel. You strain back in your crash couch as Falcon's Wing fills suddenly with water and a cruel looking Keladi appears before your eyes, claws waving. Remembering it is only a holo-projection you relax and identify yourself as a. member of TIME, codename Falcon. The Keladi replies, 'It is well I arrived quickly. I am Rrillk, Argon of the TIME research station, here in the Biruk shallows. Had not I, a member of the bond-clan of TIME, arrived first you might have been treated with hostility, even attacked.' You ask where Lord Kirik is, and Rrillk informs you that he is at the research station on the sea floor.</p>
<p>You are towed slowly to the floating platform where you leave Falcon's Wing and descend to the bottom in a lift which travels down a long transparent shaft. As you descend you see various. unusual and colourful sights. A coral-cloud, flapping its way through the sea like a scarlet underwater fern and then a shoal of Gorblefish, rainbow-hued fish with anemone heads. At the foot of the shaft, a man, Garren, is waiting, one of the consultants at the research station. He welcomes you to the air breathing section, a large, transparent dome around which several Keladi gather to stare at you. Garren informs you that Lord Kirik recently travelled into Kelados' past, to the timehole in 2710 AD. You tell Garren that you must follow him immediately and he accompanies you to the surface in the lift As you take your leave, Garren hands you a small container of pills, which he tells you are synthesised from the gills of Skorarli, the sleek predator of the depths of Kelados. They stimulate the reflexes. You thank him and take one before entering your Time Machine. Add one to your Evasion Modifier and note on your Agent Profile that you have a supply of these pills You quickly instruct CAIN to switch on the Variac Drive and, using your Psychic Awareness, plot your course through null space to the Timehole in Kelados' past.
