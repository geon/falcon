<p>You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole on present day Kelados (3033 AD). Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and,using your Psychic Awareness, locate the Timehole of present day Kelados. When you have translated this location into co-ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points.</p>
<p>The feeling of disorientation when you rematerialise persists longer than is usual. Flipping the switch for the outside camera you are dismayed to see nothing in the floodlight but green fog The machine rocks gently as if the stabilising legs were malfunctioning. With a start you remember that the surface of Kelados is one great ocean. Your altimeter tells you that the machine is floating to the surface, the hull can easily withstand the pressure of water at your depth of fifty metres. CAIN sends a TIME recognition signal to a nearby research station.</p>
<p>If you have seen a nuclear bomb, a man in golden armour named Iskander, or visited Spiro's Ringworld, turn to 300. If you have encountered none of these, turn to 264.</p>
