<p>You leave the Eiger Vault and board the hovrail, en route for the Galactic Trade Centre. As you approach its gates you are suddenly engulfed in blackness. Then you find yourself in a smoke-filled shelter, a fugitive from an alien race on your own world. The past has been changed and your memories with it. You leap out of the shelter to hurl a grenade at a strange alien aircraft on the street above you ... As Falcon, Agent of TIME, you have failed.</p>
