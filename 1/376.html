				<p>376</p>
<p>Ripping open the ambulance doors reveals a bizarre sight - six creatures like giant ants, mandibles clicking in agitation, are backing into a honeycomb structure, their dull-red, compound eyes menacing. The honeycomb is on top of a flyer similar in design to your own. They were expecting you and two are holding small blasters in their mouthparts. Before you can move they blast you backwards out of the ambulance, killing you instantly. You have failed.</p>
