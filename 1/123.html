<p>You spur your horse forward towards Murat and his staff when the source of the mental power comes into view. Two horses, one behind the other, are harnessed to a wooden, covered wagon with two small holes high up on either side for windows and doors which open at the back. A medical orderly is riding the first of the horses. It is one of the first ambulances ever made of the pattern designed by Baron Larrey, a French Army Surgeon, in 1805. You sense the strength of the mind within the strange carriage and its power seems awesome to you. As you watch, you can feel the mind reaching out to control Murat, King of Naples, Do you:</p>
