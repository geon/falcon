<p>Bloodhound passes out, slumping to the floor of the refuelling bay. You drag him to Falcon's Wing and tie him up in front of CAIN, removing his Psionic Enhancer helmet as you do so. When he comes round you show him CAIN's records. It soon becomes obvious to him that you are on a vitally important mission and that his mission to kill you must be abandoned. You untie him and return his helmet. Bloodhound says, I'm sorry, Falcon, someone has used me, someone who wants the timelines to be changed.'</p>
<p>'Who gave the order to kill me?' you ask.</p>
<p>'Our Section Chief, Agidy Yelov,' he replies. 'He told me you had killed Lord Kirik.'</p>
<p>'But Kirik has only been dead a matter of minutes,' you tell him.</p>
<p>Bloodhound pauses then says, 'Yes, of course, Falcon, how can he know of Kirik's death so soon? Either he was responsible or he is in league with the traitor that did it.' Your Section Chief is working with the Renegade Lord. Turn to 255.</p>
