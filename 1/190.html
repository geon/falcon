<p>Twin laser pulses from the Phocian ship strike your bows. The ship shudders and there is a thunderous report as the lights fail.</p>
<p>The computer flashes up a damage report:</p>

		<tr><td>LIFE SUPPORT:</td><td>BRIDGE ONLY</td></tr>
<tr><td>MAIN DRIVE:</td><td>10% EFFICIENCY</td></tr>
<tr><td>ENERGY:</td><td>LOW</td></tr>
<tr><td>ATTACK LASERS:</td><td>INTACT</td></tr>

<p>The Scanner shows a second ship approaching from behind an asteroid belt and the Phocian changes course to intercept it. The large ship flashes a Lascom message: This is the Clanship Keladan III; we are on a priority diplomatic mission. Do not attack. Repeat, do not attack. Change course. We are Keladi, do not attack.' You realise that whoever is controlling the Phocian pilot, almost certainly the Renegade Lord, is trying to kill the Keladi envoy so that Kelados and Earth will be plunged into war. You have energy enough for one attack only and in a desperate attempt to save the envoy's life you try to target and fire your lasers. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
