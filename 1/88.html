<p>You miss the Hornet and it finds its target. To your surprise it is not filled with explosive but with a drug which sends you quickly to sleep. You wake again some minutes later to find Lynx and Bloodhound struggling on the ground, locked in combat. Bloodhound is bleeding badly and Lynx is manoeuvring so that she can finish him off with the knife she is wielding. You move quietly over and chop her in the back of the neck, knocking her out cold. Bloodhound sighs with relief and thanks you. Looking around, you take stock of the situation. Everybody has moved off down the hill towards the line of battle. The Imperial Guard are marching to the attack and the ambulance, too, is trundling away down the hill. Napoleon has ordered the attack and the Renegade Lord has changed the past. Turn to 344.</p>
