<p>The members of Napoleon's staff clear a way and one of the Chasseurs rides by your side as you approach the Emperor. Napoleon's Chief of Staff, Marshal Berthier, spurs his horse forward and takes the despatch from you. He reads it quickly and passes it to the Emperor who is now in front of you. Napoleon reads it and sighs, saying, 'I've no men to spare for your headstrong Marshal Ney.' He waves you aside and you are thankful to leave the group that surrounds him to go over to Bloodhound. Turn to 82.</p>
