<p>Bloodhound's mental defences are enough to shrug off your Thinkstrike. While you pause to collect your thoughts after your effort, he blasts you once again. You double up as the plasma bolt hits your side -lose 13 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you find yourself too stunned to do anything. Bloodhound walks over to your stricken body and levels his weapon for the final blast. 'Wait, Bloodhound! Kill me and the population of all earth and the colonies may perish. I am helpless, but look at CAIN's memory banks before you void me.' He hesitates , then drags you into Falcon's Wing and ties you up. Examining CAIN's records, it soon becomes obvious to him that you are on a vitally important mission and that his mission to kill you must be abandoned. He unties you, but your wounds are so bad you must subtract one from your Evasion Modifier. Bloodhound says, 'I'm sorry. Falcon, someone has used me, someone who wants the timelines to be changed.'</p>
<p>'Who gave the order to kill me?' you ask.</p>
<p>'Our Section Chief, Agidy Yelov,' he replies. 'He told me you had killed Lord Kirik.'</p>
<p>'But Kirik has only been dead a matter of minutes,' you tell him.</p>
<p>Bloodhound pauses then says, 'Yes, of course, Falcon. How can he know of Kirik's death so soon? Either he was responsible or he is in league with the traitor that did it.' Your Section Chief is working with the Renegade Lord. Turn to 255.</p>
