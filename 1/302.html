<p>Your blaster spouts white-hot bolts of plasma, cutting a swathe through the horsemen. Ten or more perish and the squealing of their horses rings in your ears. Seeing what they take to be evil monk, they turn tail and flee. They are followed by the rest of the horsemen in the village as the word of your evil magic is shouted one to another.</p>
<p>Still carrying,the nuclear bomb, you go back to Falcon's Wing, hoping your actions have not seriously changed the Timelines. You ask CAIN to what extent you have changed the past and to your relief, he responds, 'There is no significant change, Falcon. My files do carry a tale, however, about a sorcerer who saved the village of Ramallo from the mongol horde, for a brief time. Congratulations, Falcon, you are the sorcerer of Ramallo,' CAIN then adds, 'Lucky to be alive.' You tell CAIN to shut up. Turn to 229.</p>
