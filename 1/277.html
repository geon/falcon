<p>The assassin walks calmly towards you, his voice hissing through the air escape ducts in his armour, 'What a pity, Falcon you seem to have dropped your blaster.' You are in too much pain to concentrate your mental powers, and you realise as he places his laser-rifle in front of your face that he is going to finish the job. This is the first time I've completed a commission given to me by a Lord of TIME,' he hisses. As he gloats a security droid appears, hovering soundlessly behind him, and discharge, its stun-lance. The assassin is bathed in blue light and jerks back suddenly as the circuits in his Power Armour begin to short out Unable to control the armour, which is too heavy to be moved without the assistance of its power pack, he falls on the floor. body arched like a crab, as the armour begins to steam. Sparks fly, and the power pack explodes, ripping his body apart. You may never find out who sent him to kill you. The security droid checks your ID and you drag yourself to Falcon's Wing before it can summon a Medtech. Turn to 336.</p>
