<p>Bloodhound is strong. The heavy butt of the musket narrowly misses your head, but smashes your collarbone and dislocates your shoulder. Lose 8 Endurance points. If you are still alive, your shoulder pops painfully back into its rightful place, you grab the musket and struggle with Bloodhound, rolling down the hillside together trying to wrench the musket from each other's grasp, Bloodhound tries to strangle and kick you and you are bruised and exhausted by the time you break the Renegade Lord's control of his will. Bloodhound stops fighting and you both look up to see that the Imperial Guard are marching to the attack. The Renegade Lord is changing history. You begin to run up the hillside and the ambulance comes into view a hundred yard away from the Emperor. Turn to 344.</p>
