<p>You wake up dazed, in a detention cubicle at TIME head quarters. Your arms and legs are secured through holes in couch upon which you are lying and you no longer have you helmet. You have been heavily sedated, but now you can see that the drummer boy was in fact Special Agent Lynx. She is still dressed in her drummer's uniform but her hair falls freely about her shoulders now that she has taken her shako-helmet off. She looks pleased with herself. Behind her, Yelov, amber eyes glinting, also looks satisfied. Suddenly all goes blank. Your last sight is of Yelov beginning to laugh as both you and Agent Lynx wink out. He has tricked her. It is as if you both had never existed. You have failed.</p>
