<p>The computer has been unable to keep your lasers targetted, due to your failure to stay on the Phocian's tail. The lasers do not fire. As you wrestle with the controls to attempt another attack, suddenly the screen flares as the Phocian Corsair opens fire on the Keladi ship, its lasers piercing the hull of the larger ship which lurches sickeningly. You are too late. As your finger moves to the fire button the Corsair ship rakes the envoy's ship againwith its Pulse Lasers. There is a brilliant explosion which fills the scanner screen with light and then you are suddenly engulfedin blackness. You find yourself in a smoke-filled shelter, a fugitive from an alien race on your own world. The past has been changed and your memories with it. You leap out of the shelter to hurl a grenade at a strange alien craft on the street above you ... As Falcon, Agent of TIME, you have failed.</p>
