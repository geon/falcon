<p>You instruct CAIN to engage the Variac Drive and using your Psychic Awareness, set coordinates for Earth, 1241 AD. During the journey, you may lie in your Autodoc and restore your Endurance points to 20. As you wait to rematerialise, you become aware of a flux in the psychic forces of the universe. You are forced out of null-space, but not at your destination. You look at the digital time read-out which tells you that you are in the year 1258 AD, seventeen years after the death of Ogedai Khan, Ghengis' son. Turn to 149.</p>
