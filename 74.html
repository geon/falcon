<p>Bloodhound is strong and when he misses you with the musket the force with which it hits the ground snaps it like a twig. You try to control his mind but he throws himself at you and you tumble down the hillside, locked together. Bloodhound tries to strangle and kick you. You are bruised and exhausted, by the time you break the Renegade Lord's control of his will. Lose 3 Endurancepoints. Bloodhound stops fighting and you both look up to see that the Imperial Guard are marching to the attack. The Renegade Lord is changing history. You begin to run up the hillside and the ambulance comes into view a hundred yards away from the Emperor. Turn to 344.</p>
