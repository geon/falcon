<p>Your missile breaches a hole in the Main Access portal just large enough for you to fly through. You move from the gloomy, brooding red of Mechanon's thin atmosphere to the ghostly, green luminescent lights of an enormous tunnel which stretches ahead for miles. The Access portal opens suddenly and ten Atmospheric Interceptors follow you down the tunnel, their pulse lasers winking on and off as they pour their deadly fire into your ship's defences. You switch between fore and aft scanner but you have to leave your Battle, computer to target your aft lasers while you synchronise your evasion movements with its prediction of your movements. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
