				<p>215</p>
<p>Desperately you target the lasers and let fly. You slice two in half and they fall harmlessly away, but try as you might, you are unable to hit the other one and it slams into the underside of your ship and explodes. Lose 1 Shield point or 2 Armour points. If your ship's defences have fallen below zero, turn to 276. If you have survived, your ship rocks upward but the gyros right it, and you flash onward past the fortress, lucky to be alive. Turn to 71.</p>
