<p>CAIN is silent for some moments before chiming, 'There is a correspondence between the names of members of the English nobility who were present at the battle of Crecy and the earliest of your known ancestors, Falcon. Sir Thomas Chandos, whose coat of arms is a silver falcon on a blue background, may have been a distant ancestor of yours. I assume you know that a coat of arms is the picture carried on a knight's shield and surcoat in a battle of those times? If Sir Thomas Chandos is murdered before his time, Falcon, you will never have existed.'</p>
<p>Thank you CAIN/ you reply, 'and CAIN, has it ever crossed your memory banks that even you don't know everything? I have the information I need now. Set coordinates for Crecy, 26th August, 1346 AD,' you order. Turn to 322.</p>
