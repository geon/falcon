<p>You turn the superheated plasma beam of your blaster on the immobile wardroid, an easy target. The lancing bolt of white- hot energy hits its power plant and the flash defence on your helmet automatically cuts in and the faceplate darkens as the lurid explosion lights the yellow atmosphere, hurling debris everywhere. The second wardroid unleashes a guided missile which is homing in on the heat of your body. All you can do is dive behind a rock outcropping and hope that it doesn't carry a fissionwarhead. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
