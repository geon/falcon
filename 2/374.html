<p>The arrogant Danikoi are not interested in a future in which they are not the most powerful beings. The Disputer says, 'If we can no longer protect ourselves then let it all end. Our species will no longer be fit for survival.' They turn their backs on you and you cannot make them listen. There is nothing that you can do now which will stop the Danikoi using time travel to mould history to their own decadent whims. Suddenly, everything goes dark. The Danikoi have changed history and it is as if you and the Space Federation had never existed.</p>
