<p>You walk over to his stricken form and drive your sword into the juncture between his helmet and breastplate, piercing his neck. As you pull your sword from his body a strange change overcomes you.

You recover from the shock quickly and notice that the valiant French knights are charging time and time again only to be repulsed by the fire of the English longbowmen. Turn to 162.</p>
