<p>Before you have time to fire your blaster the android fires again and you fall stunned to the ground. When you come round the android is standing motionless outside the booth, deactivated. Sirens like those of an Enforcer's jetcopter sound far away in the night as orange streaks roar overhead. There is a flash of light and a thunderous roar as a great mushroom cloud of incandescent flame and smoke erupts into the upper atmosphere. The next explosion turns your eyes to steam and strips you to a charred skeleton. The android has somehow provoked a nuclear holocaust on earth. Yelov has won.</p>
