<p>Your aim is true and you have destroyed the wardroid's hover pads. It falls to the ground with an impact that shakes the rock like an earthquake and explodes scattering lumps of corroded metal everywhere. You have destroyed the wardroid that guards the loading bay but other robots may be on their way to intercept you. A rack of Polybdenum rods stands in the bay at the back of the cavernous armadillo-like mining droid. You seize your chance to destroy it. Turn to 141.</p>
