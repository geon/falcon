<p>Your blaster discharges a crackling beam of superheated plasma at the breastplate of the French knight. A great hole is burnt in his chest and he topples dead from his horse. The immediate danger is over, but as you hide the weapon once more a strange change overcomes you. You are lucky, no-one has noticed the energy beam of your blaster, thinking it was no more than the gleam of the sun's rays off the polished metal of armour, but your breathing seems to falter and you feel weak. Your memories change. Whereas once you remembered as a child being successfully cured of a disease caused by a mutant virus, your memory now tells you that a different medtech used an inferior treatment to cure you. With a shock you realise you have just killed the ancestor of the man who would have invented the cure. He will never have existed. You lose 3 Endurance points and your total Endurance may now never exceed 17. You recover from the shock quickly and notice that the valiant French knights are charging time and time again only to be repulsed by the fire of the English longbowmen. Turn to 162.</p>
