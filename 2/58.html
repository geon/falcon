<p>Your camera scans the gently rolling countryside of mediaeval northern France. Falcon's Wing stands on a hill overlooking a gentle slope on which stands the English army. Descending the hills opposite is the French Army, which seems about five times as large. It is mid afternoon, but the vanguard of the French army are advancing to the attack, led by six thousand or so mercenary troops, crossbowmen from Genoa, followed by double that number of mounted knights in full plate armour, the flower of chivalry, their shields and banners a glorious riot of colour. Behind these, and still trooping to the battlefield, are countless peasant infantry, some armed with pikes, but many making do with scythes roped to poles. The English army numbers a little over ten thousand men, composed of knights who have dismounted and will fight on foot, brave Welsh spearmen and a large number of longbowmen.</p>
<p>CAIN tells you that if history is unchanged, the quick fire of the English bowmen will be the weapon that wins total victory. If the French were to win the battle CAIN cannot compute a likely outcome but Edward HI, King of England, might be deposed and the Hundred Years War might never be. France would probably grow much stronger than England or Spain. You decide to station yourself amongst the ranks of the English who are divided into three. Nearest to you are the reserves, and CAIN identifies the golden lions and fleur de lis of their leader, King Edward. Before these is another body of knights led by the young King's son, the Black Prince, who is surrounded by veteran knights, one of whom, Sir Thomas Chandos, bears a silver falcon on his red shield. A way to the left lies the third body of knights, lead by William de Bohun, Earl of Northampton, whose blue shield carries three red stars and six golden lions. The men of Northampton and the Black Prince are linked by a line of archers. Where will you position yourself?</p>
