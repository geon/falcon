<p>The wardroids of Mechanon have built an enormous time travel ship using Polybdenum from Thrix. Suddenly it appears in the Eiger Vault, and countless Wardroids pour out of it. The ship winks out once more, to pick up reinforcements. There are already four hundred of them, Interceptors, missile platforms and hovering fortresses and there is nothing you can do to stop them conquering the world, as the beam of a particle disruptor spreads you thinly across the shell of Falcon's Wing. You have failed.</p>
