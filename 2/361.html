<p>The computer's tones are calm once more as it says, 'You must leave now, intruder.' Ignoring it, you look around for what may be the computer's core. It is difficult to tell one part of the enormous electronic brain from another so you decide to use your particle disruptor on all of it. As its memory banks are destroyed one by one the computer threatens you that the whole planet will explode, killing you, if you continue. As your beam of destruction creeps towards a large steel pyramid the computer's tone changes to a wheedling whine. 'Cease immediately, intruder, or I shall launch the planet killer at Earth.' Still ignoring it, you play your beam across the pyramid which seems to melt away to nothing as if by magic. Suddenly everything goes haywire. Lights flash everywhere and then dim as the main generators shut down. You manage to find your way back out of the tunnel in the darkness by the searchlight of your battlesuit helmet and climb into your Strike Fighter once more. The sound of distant explosions rocks the tunnel as you climb into your crash-couch. To your relief the ion drives are operational again now that they have cooled down, and you gun the fighter through the blackness of the tunnel, aiming for the white pin pricks of the stars of Mechanon's night sky at its end. There is a blinding flash and the tunnel is filled with light as another immense explosion rocks the complex, and the walls begin to cave in on you. You make it to the end of the tunnel just in time and hurtle skyward. Turn to 411.</p>
