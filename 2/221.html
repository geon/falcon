<p>You play the beam of your particle disruptor over the generator as Yelov takes aim again. There is a sudden flash behind him and a gust of wind rushes past you and out of the tunnel, now that the invisible force field is destroyed. Noxious vapours stream in around you and Yelov is propelled, choking, to a hatch in the side of the tunnel that opens by the raildroid's grav-beam. You fire a rocket and then jet towards him, but he is through the hatchway in a twinkling. The droid's shield blocks the rocket, but the explosion damages its circuitry and it jars to a standstill. Using your particle disrupter you carve a hole in the tunnel wall and fly through it, after Yelov. Turn to 412.</p>
