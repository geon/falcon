<p>You fly towards the raildroid and set off two rockets before training your particle disruptor on Yelov. The droid's shield moves into place in front of Yelov and its outer edge must be in a stasis field for it is unaffected even by a particle disruptor. Yelov's accuracy with his blaster is breathtaking as he shoots down both of the rockets before they reach him. The raildroid hums as it accelerates along the rail towards you. You jet away but you are too late. You are caught and held in mid-air by its grav-beam. Once more Yelov displays his skill with the blaster as he aims it at the faceplate of your battlesuit. The high tensile plexiglass is vapourised and Yelov pauses to sneer before doing the same to your face. You have failed.</p>
