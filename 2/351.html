<p>You surge forward towards the Central Computer Complex and the cavernous mouth of the hangar lined with space- artillery. A huge cavernous tunnel stretches away beyond the hangar mouth and a motley assortment of droids are being repaired at intervals along it. Three rails run the length of it, some distance from the floor. A huge access portal opens briefly and an Atmospheric Interceptor zooms out of it towards you. If you have the Main Access Code, you may turn to the paragraph number given for it. If you would like to fly on down through the immense arcing span of this tunnel, turn to 375. If you would like to blast a way through the Main Access portal, turn to 219, Or you could dive sharp left above the smaller tunnel which you walked down on your first visit to Mechanon and blast through the vaulted roof at the point where Bloodhound and Lynx rescued you. Turn to 366.</p>
