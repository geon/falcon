<p>You choose a high arcing trajectory for the throw of your grenade but one of the wardroids, reacting with superhuman speed, shoots up and smashes into the grenade in mid air, causing it to explode before it hits the Polybdenum. The wardroid is immobilised, its gyros gone, and it crashes to the ground, though it is still functional. The other wardroid has locked onto you, however, and it fires at you with a pulse of energy from one of its weapon banks that catches you in the thigh. Lose 8 Endurance points. If you are still alive, your suit has begun to repair itself in time to prevent any of the atmosphere entering and you leap for cover. Turn to 345.</p>
