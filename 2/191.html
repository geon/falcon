				<p>191</p>
<p>Yelov misses you with the plasma pistol, but he rushes you with a speed that shows that both of his legs are bionic. He is having himself transformed into a walking death machine. He punches you with his bionic arm which is twenty times as powerful as any man's. You hurtle backwards and smash into a computer terminal. Subtract 1 from your Suit Armour. If your armour is at zero or less, turn to 161. Otherwise, the computer screams at Yelov not to hurt it as you leap up and drive your powered fist towards Yelov's face. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
