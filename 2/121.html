<p>You manage to dominate the will of the Disputer, but the others sense what you are doing and shun you. Controlling one mind on the free world of Danikos, which needs no enforcers or weapons, will not help you. They file out one by one. There is nothing that you can do now which will stop the Danikoi using time travel to mould history to their own decadent whims. Suddenly, everything goes dark. The Danikoi have changed history and it is as if you and the Space Federation had never existed.</p>
