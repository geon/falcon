<p>CAIN responds, 'It is not within the capability of this Strike Fighter to destroy the planet killer. There is only one thing that can be done. You will have to break the First Law of TIME, Falcon. There is a timehole, fifty millennia ago, on Danikos. You must try and change history so that the Danikoi will never build Mechanon. Remember, Falcon, the Danikoi were far more advanced than any other species in the galaxy at that time. You must try to convince them not to allow Earth to be destroyed. You set coordinates for Danikos fifty thousand years ago. Your Strike Fighter has no Autodoc but you have time to dress any wounds you have suffered while you are in the void of null- space. Restore up to 2 points of lost Endurance points and turn to 105.</p>
