<p>You hurtle onward like a bullet. A missile base on the left wall comesinto view and a thin corridor branches off to the right. Ahead you can see the cavernous hangar and a droid running on rails below you. Suddenly an Atmospheric Interceptor bursts out of the corridor to the right. With a swift blast of your fission beams you destroy it, but the missile base launches a salvo of sleek homing missiles and the plasma cannons ringing the rim of the hangar entrance turn inward and fire simultaneously. Twenty balls of superheated plasma streak towards you. The corridoris filled from top to bottom and all its length with a great sea of boiling plasma as the shells explode, completely vapourising you and your ship. You have failed.</p>
