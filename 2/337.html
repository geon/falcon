				<p>337</p>
<p>You lead the huge missile in a series of daring manoeuvres down towards a huge metal building with row after row of stunted black glasteel chimneys. You pull up at the last minute, but the missile responds too late. You turn to watch as it screams into a fuel refinery. The explosion flattens factories for a mile around, the shock wave throws you across the sky and a pillar of flame, smoking blackly, reaches far into the atmosphere above you. You fly back towards the gaping maw of the hangar. Turn to 351.</p>
