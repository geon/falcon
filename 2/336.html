<p>The twin fission beams meet and play across the surface of the intruder detection satellite and an opaque sphere of violet light surrounds it. It is a defence shield and although you play the beams across it for as long as you can, it still holds. CAIN alerts you to three guided missiles which the satellite is causing to home in on you from the dull red surface of Mechanon. They are too close for you to use electronic counter measures so you turn away from them and try to pick them off with your aft point laser, as CAIN switches to rear scanner. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
