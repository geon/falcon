<p>You slam the Fighter into a dive but a plasma shell smashes into the hull, rocking the ship with an awful blast of exploding plasma. Lose 2 Deflector Shield points or 1 Armour point. If your ship defence score is below zero, turn to 90. If you survive, the gyros stabilise the ship and you hurtle downward as the second plasma shell passes overhead and explodes in the tunnel behind you filling it with burning white plasma. You pull up, hugging the ground. The fortress lies directly ahead and three sleek and deadly dart-shaped missiles fly from one of its bases, launch up behind, and dive in unison towards you. Instinctively you fire fission beams which lance out across the surface and into the fortress, destroying its plasma turrets. You gun the ship into a steep climb as the missiles streak in your direction, filling your forward screen. Desperately you engage the electronic counter measures. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
