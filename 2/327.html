<p>You slam the Fighter into a dive and hurtle towards the ground. The plasma shells pass overhead and explode, with a crackling roar that sounds like thunder, filling the area behind you with burning white plasma. You pull up, hugging the ground.

Instinctively you fire fission beams which lance out across the surface and into the fortress, destroying its plasma turrets. You gun the ship into a steep climb as the missiles streak in your direction, filling your forward screen. Desperately you engage the electronic counter measures. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
