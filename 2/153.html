<p>Deadshot Yelov is too quick for you. The plasma bolt from his blaster rips a neat hole in the back of your suit. You fall stunned and the yellow gas of the Thrixian atmosphere invades your lungs. The plasnet of your suit tries to repair itself automati- cally, but Yelov turns down his blaster and uses it to keep the hole open. There is nothing you can do as your lungs turn to an acidified froth. Your death is indeed lingering and painful.</p>
