				<p>270</p>
<p>Just as the hunter-seeker reaches you, the jet pack carries you straight upwards. The mine hits the ground just behind the spot where you had been standing and there is a hissing and a great cloud of steam as it buries itself several feet into the rock beneath the steel floor. Yelov crouches low on the raildroid as the interceptor makes another attack run. You fire a rocket at it which blows one of its side planes off and the interceptor spins, out of control, into an energy wall where it explodes. Turn to 272.</p>
