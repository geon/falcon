<p>You have stopped only one of the missiles, cutting off its drive tube, and it tumbles harmlessly past you. The other two home in and detonate. The ship rocks and the gyros whir as it rights itself. Your hull armour or shields have saved you from certain destruction, but your ship has taken damage.
