<p>You bank and hurtle down the enormous side tunnel like a bullet, and an incredible sight greets you. The floor of the corridor is a huge droid factory, production lines stretch endlessly for miles ahead and the walls and floor are crawling with droids, like ants in an anthill. One side of the corridor is lined with rank upon rank of wardroids, waiting for activation. You speed onward at Mach 5, eating up the miles. Something glowing a bright electric blue seems to grow ahead of you as you approach it. Turn to 340.</p>
