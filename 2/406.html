<p>The force field falters and then disappears. You gun the Strike Fighter through the gap but the field is rekindled just as you are half way through. The power surge plays havoc with the Fighter's Ion Drive and CAIN tells you that he must shut down the Drive before it explodes. You have passed through into yet another tunnel at the end of which you Can see the stars of Mechanon's night sky. You are forced to crash land and the Strike Fighter skids for half a mile along the steel floor of the tunnel, throwing you about in your crash-couch harness like a bobsleigh until it comes to a rest. You check the air supply of your battlesuit and then blow the cockpit seals and jump out. There is a whirring noise in the distance and a rail above your head starts to vibrate slightly. You decide to test your jetpack and fly up to the rail. A raildroid looms rapidly larger as it speeds along towards you. You are about to fire your suit's particle disrupter when you see a living being riding on a disc attached to the droid. It slows as it approaches you and you recognise Agidy Yelov. On his own Yelov is a dangerous customer, with all his new toys to help him kill you, you sense that you will do well to survive. The thin atmosphere has been changed to suit the Siriun in this part of the complex and he has no need of a space suit. Yelov recognises you and curses. 'Kill or be killed, Falcon/ he threatens, and lets a small, white object fall from his hand as an Atmospheric Interceptor enters the tunnel in the far distance. You decide to dodge in case the Interceptor is about to fire its laser. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
