<p>The mind of this rock-being is so alien that you don't know where to begin with your assault on its will. The Thrix is entirely unaffected, but it seems to think that you have made a gesture of friendship and it touches your mind with its own. It clicks at you and your translator goes into operation. The Thrix is saying, 'It is a fact that you are not one of the killer types, but what did you mean by your flash of white fire?' Will you reply:</p>

		<table>
			
						<tr>
							<td>It was a gesture of greeting and friendship?</td>
							<td><a href="95.html">Turn to 95</a></td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>I am sorry, it is a weapon and I thought you were trying to kill me?</td>
							<td><a href="78.html">Turn to 78</a></td>
						</tr>
