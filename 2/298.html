<p>There wasn't enough time for your electronic counter measures to take effect and all three of the missiles cannon into the underside of the Strike Fighter, exploding simultaneously. Lose3 Energy Shield points or 5 Hull Armour points. If your ship defences have fallen below zero, turn to 276. If you have survived, the ship is rocked upward with the force of the explosion, but the gyros right it and you hurtle on, past the fortress, lucky to be alive. Turn to 71.</p>
