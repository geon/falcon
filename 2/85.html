<p>You press the launch button and the launch doors fly apart as you are hurtled out of Falcon's Wing. Waiting until you are far enough away from Falcon's Wing to avoid causing exhaust damage, you cut in the Flyer's Ion Drive and accelerate to Mach 3. The Flyer's instruments indicate that your Ion Drive's exhaust is being tracked and the radar shows three ballistic missiles speeding towards your Time Machine. You avoid them with ease, but two of them score direct hits on Falcon's Wing and a third destroys the mining droid behind it. The Flyer has rocked by the blast. When the cloud of pulverised dust has settled nothing remains of Falcon's Wing. You are trapped time and space on the soul-less factory world of Mechanon with only two days' supply of recyclable oxygen in your Flyer.</p>
<p>Your radar screen picks up another salvo of incoming missiles. You flick the joystick left and backwards but the missiles are: homing in on you. Only a sharp turn at the moment before impact will save you. Make an Evasion Roll but count your Evasion Modifier as zero.</p>
