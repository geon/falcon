<p>You concentrate your mind and try to dominate the will of this sentient rock, but its mind is so alien you don't know where to begin. The Thrix is entirely unaffected but it seems to think that you have made a gesture of friendship and it opens its mind more fully to you. Its name translates, in a shortened form, to Carborundum. It clicks at you and your translator tells you that it is beckoning you. Suddenly it lurches and begins to roll across the ground. You decide to follow warily. Turn to 53.</p>
