				<p>230</p>
<p>Desperately you target the lasers and let fly. You slice one in two and it falls harmlessly away, but try as you might, you are unable to hit the other two and they slam into the underside of your ship, exploding simultaneously. Lose 2 Shield points or 3 Armour points.</p>
<p>If your ship's defences have fallen below zero, turn to 276. If you have survived, your ship rocks upward but the gyros right it and you flash onward past the fortress, lucky to be alive. Turn to 71.</p>
