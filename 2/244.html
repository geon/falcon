<p>The bolt of superheated plasma plays across the android and at explodes. The blast knocks you off the wall, lose 3 Endurancepoints. If you are still alive, you regain your senses to the sound of a siren, like that of an Enforcer's jetcopter whining nearby, and two men in navy blue uniforms run towards you from the recreation centre. Still groggy, you jump for the wall and try to scramble over before they catch you. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
