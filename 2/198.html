<p>For long anxious moments you wait for the searing pain which will tell you that a laser cannon is ending your existence, but the wardroids roar overhead creating a whirlpool of dust and mist. Their infra-red sensors, which see only heat, have lost your trace. You return the temperature control of your suit to normal, but you had not calculated on the added effect of the naturally low temperature on this freezing planet. You are already suffering severe frostbite. Lose 2 Endurance points. If you are still alive, CAIN radios you to say that the timehole on Thrix is closing and you run back to Falcon's Wing. Turn to 284.</p>
