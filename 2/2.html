<p>As you open your mind to the alien you find yourself having to make a great effort to remain sane and regain your human sense of perspective. The Thrix live for millennia on a cold and lifeless world, barren of architecture - they have no need of building, and of almost everything else that you associate with civilisation. You realise that something terrible is happening on this long-peaceful planet and that it wants you to accompany is towards a mining complex which is as alien to the Thrix as it is to you. The Thrix's name translates as Carborundum. Suddenly it lurches and begins to roll across the rocky ground. You decide to follow warily. Turn to 53.</p>
