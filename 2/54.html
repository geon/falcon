<p>To your horror you realise that the Main Access is guarded by a reaction damping field. A small hole opens in one of the metal plates but it is too small for you to fly through. You pull up and roar skywards as the Atmospheric Interceptors swarm all around you. You try everything you know to shake them off, downing five of them at the same time, but in the end, weight of numbers tells. Your ship's defences are destroyed and a pulsing laser beam causes your Strike Fighter to explode. You are consumed with it in a ball of orange flame. You have failed.</p>
