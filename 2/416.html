<p>It takes you some time to find the capsule as it has crashed into a deep wood. When you do, you realise that there is nothing to sabotage, the capsule was designed for a one way trip and could never return to space. Its only purpose was to deliver the android which is now lost in the Devonian night. You return to the road and walk for some miles without locating the android. Suddenly you look up to see several orange streaks in the sky. There is a flash of light and a thunderous roar as a great mushroom cloud of incandescent flame and smoke erupts into the upper atmosphere. The next explosion turns your eyes to steam and strips you to a charred skeleton. The android has somehow provoked a nuclear holocaust on Earth; Yelov has won.</p>
