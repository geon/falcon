<p>Your thumbs press down on the joystick firing buttons and twin fission beams leap from the Fighter's wing tips, nearly vapourising the launcher and causing the missiles to explode, destroying much of the fortress' sensor banks. Before you can do anything further, two plasma shells slam into the hull of your ship with a crackling roar and you are engulfed in a ball of burning white plasma. Lose 2 Shield points or 3 Armour. If your defence points are below zero, turn to 90. If you have survived, your Strike Fighter bucks wildly but the gyros, whining shrilly, manage to right it. You are brought to a standstill but engage the booster thrusters and surge forward over the fortress, the G-force dampers working overtime. Turn to 71.</p>
