<p>In the safety of Falcon's Wing you reconsider the situation. The disturbances in the timelines of the two planets, Thrix and Mechanon, are clearly related. As time is pressing and Yelov has bought himself several hours by tying you up here at Crecy you decide to ask for just one more item of information. Will you ask CAIN:</p>

		<table>
			
						<tr>
							<td>What forces Mechanon could provide if it was saved from destruction?</td>
							<td><a href="239.html">Turn to 239</a></td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Whether Mechanon and/or Thrix have the Polybdenum necessary for Yelov to make many time trips?</td>
							<td><a href="248.html">Turn to 248</a></td>
						</tr>
		</table>
