				<p>303</p>
<p>The faceplate of your helmet darkens automatically as the fluid reacts with the crystals to compensate for the glare of your exploding grenade which landed right next to the Polybdenum. The rods of ore are destroyed but one of the wardroids has locked onto you and it reacts with the speed that only a robot boasts. A pulse of energy leaves its weapon bank and you are hurled backwards. Lose 10 Endurance points. If you are still alive, your suit repairs itself before the acid atmosphere of Thrix can enter. As quick as thought, you send another grenade hurtling towards the droid. Turn to 263.</p>
