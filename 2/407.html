<p>Your plasma blast ionises the gas in a long stream like a ribbon, turning it from yellow to red, but it has passed beneath the wardroid which unleashes a homing missile towards you. As you roll behind a rock you pass through the laser beam of the immobile wardroid which severs you neatly in two at the waist. The shock kills you before the homing missile smears your remains over the rocky surface of Thrix.</p>
