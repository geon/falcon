<p>Your power armour battlesuit has been breached and its power plant burns out. You are locked in position like a statue. The suit is too heavy for you to move it using your own strength. Yelov walks slowly up to you grinning evilly and says, 'I said it was kill or be killed, Falcon, and I meant it. I also promised when we met on Thrix that your death would be as lingering and painful as the technology of Mechanon could devise.' Yelov is true to his word. After two years of torture you are utterly insane, no better than a slavering beast. Yelov tires of his sport one day and orders your life-support system to be turned off.</p>
