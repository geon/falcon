<p>As you head towards the hangar-like opening in the building behind the dismantled Time Machine, your radar picks up ten fast-moving objects closing quickly. As you begin to decelerate before entering the building, ten Atmospheric Interceptors dive on you. They are automatic flying droids, somewhat larger than and as fast as your Flyer. You catch sight of laser cannon mountings and missile tubes. You must try to weave the Flyer into the hangar before you are hit. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
