<p>'Ah, Falcon, I was about to call for you. Agidy Yelov escaped from the detention centre nine minutes ago!'</p>
<p>'But that's impossible ...' you begin, until you realise that you have changed history and this is not the same Earth that you left a few hours ago. While you tell Jobanque where you have been he listens in amazement. By convincing the Danikoi never to build Mechanon you have saved Earth and the Space Federation and now it is as if Mechanon had never existed. Even CAIN's data banks have been changed. You are the only one who will ever really know what might have been. Jobanque believes your story and he compliments you on your success.</p>
<p>'No medals this time, Falcon. We would never convince the Federation that your story is true! Sounds like you've had. quite an exciting time! But rest now, take ten days' vacation. I'll arrange a trip to Titan if you like. I'll have to use another agent to track down Yelov (who never died now, of course!). If you go into the recreation centre ask Sparrowhawk to see me. She may know the workings of a fellow Siriun's mind. Happy holiday, Falcon - use it well.' Barely able to adjust to the fact that a part of your life simply never took place as far an your colleagues are concerned, you walk into the recreation centre in a daze. Bloodhound is leaning close to Sparrowhawk who looks troubled. You ask her to report to Jobanque and, as she leaves, Bloodhound asks you how the test flight went.</p>
<p>'What test flight?' you exclaim, and tell him your incredible story.</p>
<p>You cannot tell whether Bloodhound believes you or not he infuriates you, pretending that you are mad, but at last he says, 'Well, you're as sane as the rest of us. Falcon, and I know you would never lie. But if you were changing history, couldn't you have arranged for me to have a solar-racer while you were at it?'</p>
<p>Ignoring Bloodhound's idiocy you protest, 'I have changed history. Why am I the only one to have memories of Mechanon? CAIN was there too.'</p>
<p>'Sounds like a question for the techs to me,'says Bloodhound 'You're a walking time paradox. Ask Skirrow - if he doesn't know, nobody will!' You shrug your shoulders and decide instead to make the most of your trip to the pleasure-dome on Titan.</p>
