<p>You are about to make your way back to Falcon's Wing when a machine shaped like a flying beetle appears in the yellow mist before you. A red light shines on its belly and a form glides to the ground on a disc of metal. With a shock you realise that it is a huge Time Machine and the form is that of the arch villain, Agidy Yelov. A field of orange energy crackles around him; it seems he has stolen the force-field technology of the Creche. He is able to stand unprotected on Thrix, inside the defensive shield. Seeing you and the destroyed Polybdenum he screams with rage. The half of his face which you can see twists in a spasm and his robot arm twitches. In the wisps of yellow fog he looks like a foul demon from the blackest hell. He shouts, 'I thought I had erased you from existence at the battle of Crecy, Falcon. You've meddled with my plans once again, but you cannot stop me this time, I have the most deadly arsenal the universe will ever know ready to obey my every command. I shall re-program every droid, Falcon, so that your death, which is imminent, will be as slow and painful as the technology of Mechanon can devise.' Just then two wardroids appear above the mining complex and as you look up Yelov draws his blaster. You try desperately to get behind the scarred plasteel loading rack before he kills you, but Yelov is very fast and a superb marksman. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
