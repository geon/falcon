<p>The plasma shell explodes close enough to damage your Strike Fighter. If you are equipped with Zeiss Deflector Shields they are drained by 2 points. If you are not, your Titanium Hull Armour has taken 1 point of damage. The Atmospheric Interceptor is about to open fire on you. You pull your starship into a loop and bring it into your forward sights before firing your twin fission beams. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
