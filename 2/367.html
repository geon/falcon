<p>The Battle computer locks onto its target and your finger stabs out to the button that launches the fission warhead. It streaks away from you and hammers into the generator with a great roar. The generator is engulfed in flame, however it is not destroyed. A deflector screen glows red, purple and then black around the generator as it tries to withstand the force of the fission warhead. As the explosion dissipates the generator overloads and the force field flickers and disappears. Immediately, you use your booster thrusts to fire your Strike Fighter through the gap before the generator begins functioning again. Turn to 406.</p>
