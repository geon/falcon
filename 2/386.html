<p>You re-emerge behind the Mechanon starship once more, but this time it is the dull red of the factory planet which hangs beneath you, not the white cratered moon of Earth. Your scanners detect a communication from the starship to what is referred to as Intruder Detection Satellite ID 53, and the starship re-enters Mechanon's thin atmosphere, to land on the launch field near the Central Computer Complex. You follow it down. Turn to 325.</p>
