<p>As the French knights flow past you in pursuit of the English men at arms, hacking at you with their swords as they go, you concentrate your thoughts and hurl blast after blast of mental energy at them even while catching sword blows on your shield. You topple several from the saddle. The impetus of their charge slows and just at the right moment twenty English knights arrive, having been ordered to the Black Prince's position by King Edward when his son and his son's banner had been thrown to the ground. The English rally and after fierce fighting the French are repulsed once more. You regain the safety of Falcon's Wing, suffering no more than the mockery of some camp followers who think that you are fleeing the battle in fear. CAIN tells you that his scanners registered the fact that the Black Knight was a droid from Mechanon, and that it must have been programmed to kill Sir Thomas Chandos who is probably your ancestor. 'Be careful Falcon, Yelov is trying to kill you.' If you didn't know that electronic brains are not programmed to register emotion CAIN's tone would have you believe CAIN was worried on your behalf. You ask CAIN what effect the changes in history will have. CAIN is silent for some seconds before replying, 'King Edward will still take Calais from the French and most of the changes will be cancelled out by the terrible plague called the Black Death that will sweep Europe in two years' time.'</p>
<p>You can see on the console screen that the battle is continuing. The Black Prince is alive, another horse between his knees, and his standard has been raised once more. The camera zooms in on the leader of yet another French charge. CAIN tells you that the man in the visor-less helmet tied to two other knights who are leading his horse into battle is King John the Blind of Bohemia. Once again the French charge is broken by the English archers and is thrown back. You can see the blind king lying dead on the field,still tied to his brave knights. It is already dusk and the Englishhave almost won the day. There is nothing more for you to do here in mediaeval France. Turn to 294.</p>
