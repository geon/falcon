<p>The grenade which you have hurled lands underneath one of the wardroids but the other one locks onto you with its energy weapon banks and fires an Ion Beam at you. The grenade goes off and the wardroid lurches, one of its hover pads destroyed - it is still functional but immobilised. You dart behind a boulder as the Ion Beam seeks you out. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
