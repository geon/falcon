<p>Your ship swamps the missiles with electronic jamming signals and they all explode simultaneously. They were too close and your ship rocks with the force of the blast. Lose 1 Shield point or 2 Armour points. If your ship's defences have fallen below zero, turn to 276. If you have survived, you leave the fortress far behind. Turn to 71.</p>
