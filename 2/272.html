<p>You turn your attention to Yelov once again just as he fires his blaster at you. The beam which it emits does not crackle and it is a glassy purple. It has been modified to deliver a higher intensity beam by the wardroids of Mechanon. You use your jetpack to throw yourself out of the path of the beam but not before your battlesuit takes 2 points of damage. The heat is so intense that the suit cannot protect you fully and you suffer serious burns. Lose 3 Endurance points. If you are still alive, will you use on Yelov:</p>
