<p>You were not fast enough and the energy pulse picks you up and hurls you bodily against a rock outcropping. The plasnet of your suit repairs itself automatically, but the blast and the acid gas of Thrix's atmosphere which seeped into your suit have reduced your Endurance by 10 points. If you are still alive, the contaminated wounds will heal poorly - subtract 1 from your maximum Endurance forever. You have a split second in which to fire before the wardroid unleashes another blast of energy. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
