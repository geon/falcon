<p>You realise that before you type in the coordinates for a new destination in time and space you must have formulated a good guess as to what Yelov's plan is. Consider the three possibilities set below and decide which, in your opinion, knowing Yelov as you do, is the most likely.</p>
<p>A: Agidy Yelov is using the wardroids of Mechanon to build an impregnable fortress on the inhospitable planet Thrix where he can make himself safe from the Space Federation who might be happy to leave him there to rot.</p>
<p>B: Agidy Yelov is moving the wardroids of Mechanon to the planet Thrix before they are destroyed by the nuclear catastrophe on Mechanon where he will hide them until he is ready to attack Earth by moving them into the timehole at the Eiger Vault in 3033 AD.</p>
<p>C: Agidy Yelov has already prevented the nuclear catastrophe on Mechanon and is travelling to Thrix in order to collect enough Polybdenum to ship the deadly arsenal of wardroids through time to attack the Federation.</p>
