<p>You are caught by the beam from the android's stunner and stagger, fighting to regain your senses. A man almost trips as he comes out of a hut labelled 'Gentlemen' and stands, swaying, his mouth open in surprise. The droid turns his stunner on him and he crumples to the ground, belching. You may use the moment's respite to climb the courtyard wall and cut the cable which leads to the telephone booth, turn to 188, or if you wish to use your blaster, make an Attack Roll.</p>
<p>If you score 4-12, turn to 92</p>
<p>If you score 2-3, turn to 101</p>
