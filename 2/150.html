<p>You run out of time before you have trained the lasers onto their target. The image of the missile completely fills the rear scanner screen as it hits you. There is a sickening lurch and a horrifying explosion, but you cannot believe it when, a second later, you are still alive. Evidently the defences of your Weeks/Senior Strike Fighter almost defy belief. The Atmos- pheric Interceptors fly through the blast and are destroyed.</p>
<p>I here is damage, however. You have lost 4 pointsfrom your Energy Shields or 7 points from your Titanium Hull Armour. If your ship's defences are at zero or below, all of the circuits overload, turn to 276. If you are above this figure, turn to 28.</p>
