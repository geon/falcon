<p>You stand and hurl your grenade which arcs through the gaseous mist towards the wardroid and then pull your blaster. The electronic circuitry of the droid reacts faster than thought and a pulse of energy from its weapon banks picks you up and hurls you bodily against a rock outcropping. The plasnet of your suit repairs itself automatically but the blast and the acid gas of Thrix's atmosphere which seeped into your suit have reduced your Endurance by 10 points. If you are still alive, the contaminated wounds will heal poorly - subtract 1 from your maximum Endurance points forever. Your grenade explodes, destroying the hover pads of the wardroid which falls to the rocky ground, immobilised. In a split second you have recovered and unleashed a lancing bolt of white-hot energy which hits its power plant and the flash defence on your helmet automatically cuts in and the faceplate darkens as the lurid explosion lights the yellow atmosphere, hurling debris everywhere. You have destroyed the wardroid that guards the loading bay but other robots may be on their way to intercept you. A rack of Polybdenum rods stands in the bay at the back of the cavernous armadillo-like mining droid. You seize your chance to destroy it. Turn to 141.</p>
