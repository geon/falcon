<p>It is more difficult to dodge in the battlesuit than without it and the grab latches onto you, the four metal plates of its claw each as large as you. It crushes you and even your armoured power suit begins to buckle. Subtract 2 from your battlesuit armour points and 4 Endurance points as your ribs crack in several places. If your battlesuit armour is at zero or less, turn to 161. If not, and you are still alive, luckily you have your arms free and you blast the grab with your disruptor and fall to your feet as it crumbles to dust. You must try to dodge again - Yelov has wrenched a huge girder from the floor with his bionic arm and is swinging its end at you. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
