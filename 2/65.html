<p>Your blaster melts the droid's sound sensor and it begins to move erratically, unable to locate you. After a time it simply drifts away. You run on towards the hangar-like opening of the large fluorescent building. As you run, three flying droids Atmospheric Interceptors, with swept-back wings and pulse laser cannons swoop on you, strafing you with pulses of deadly red light. You zig zag towards an abandoned worker droid hoping to shelter beneath it. Make an Evasion Roll as the Interceptors scream overhead.</p>
