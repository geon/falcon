<p>Suddenly you find yourself back in TIME headquarters, and the battlefield of Crecy is a fast-fading memory. Your actions have changed history. Count Louis de Nevers of Flanders survived the battle in which he should have been killed. His descendant is a brilliant young woman who scored even more highly than you in training at the Academy. Now she is Agent Falcon and you are working in the Monitoring Section hoping that one day you will be given the chance to be a Special Agent. Unless the new Falcon can foil Yelov the chance will never come. There is an incoming message on the monitoring console screen.</p>
<h2>MESSAGE</h2>
