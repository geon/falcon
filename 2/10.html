<p>You open the doors and try to throw the android outside but it is enormously heavy and powerful. It picks you up in One hand and throws you against the wall with the force of a linear accelerator. You lose 9 Endurance points. A man suffering from an illness which affects his coordination staggers out of the urinal and advises you to wait and make your call later before tripping up over the back step of the recreation centre. The android continues to use the telephone but leans out and points a stunner at you. Make an Evasion Roll!</p>
