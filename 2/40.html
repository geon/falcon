<p>The beam of your particle disruptor flays Yelov's bionic arm until there is nothing left but smoke. His nerves react as though you had blown off his real arm again and he collapses to the floor. You step towards him to finish it, but the computer opens a hatchway beneath your feet and you fall through it. You blast with your jetpack but the hatchway closes, trapping you at the neck. The floor starts to buckle under the surge of the jets and you pound the floor with your power-suited fists. You tear feverishly at the warping metal as Yelov begins to recover. Make an Evasion Roll as you try to burst free from the trap.</p>
