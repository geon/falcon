<p>The Danikoi, a highly intelligent humanoid race, were the first known space travellers. Their civilisation crumbled millennia ago but a small group of Danikoi, realising that their race was doomed, decided to leave a lasting monument to their society.' They built robots which could build and program more robots made from the materials mined on the metal rich world of Mechanon. Mechanon became a single immense factory which lasted long beyond the last visit of a Danikoi spaceship. Unfortunately, the Danikoi had caused the original robots to be programmed to take whatever steps were necessary to ensure that Mechanon remained a lasting testament to the glory of Danikoi technology. The robots of Mechanon sought to assemble space weapons with which they could wipe out all intelligent life, throughout the universe, for there was no other way for them to ensure that Mechanon remained forever.</p>
<p>In 2291 AD, prior to the launch of the roboships, a nuclear disaster reduced the planet to a featureless mass of fused metal and rock. None of the wardroids of Mechanon remained functional.</p>
