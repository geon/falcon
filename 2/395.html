<p>You stride on through the yellow mist, slowed by the high gravity, towards the armadillo-like mining droid. Suddenly the mist churns before you and out of it bursts a large wardroid, hovering ten feet up, on four large discs - hover thrusters. Its top part is crammed with sensors and other indefinable electronic gear, protected by heavy armour. It has several weapon banks - laser cannon, mortar-tube clusters, Ion Beam energy weapons, hi-explosive machine rifles and so on. A huge swivelling gun is moving to target on you. You must blast it before it blasts you. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
