<p>You regain the safety of Falcon's Wing, suffering no more than the mockery of some camp followers who think that you are fleeing the battle in fear. CAIN tells you that his scanners registered the fact that the Black Knight was a droid from Mechanon, and that it must have been programmed to kill Sir Thomas Chandos who is probably your ancestor. 'Be careful, Falcon, Yelov is trying to kill you.' If you didn't know that electronic brains are not programmed to register emotion, CAIN's tone would have you believe he was worried on your behalf. You can see on the console screen that the English are losing the battle, but it is too late for you to do anything about it. You ask CAIN to evaluate the extent to which history has been changed. CAIN purrs quietly for some moments before reporting that, whilst the Black Prince lives, most of the French leaders have been killed, with the exception of Count Louis de Nevers who will now kill the ancestor of the man who invented the energy deflector shields for Federation warships, at the battle of Poitiers. Note down on your Adventure Sheet that Count Louis survived the battle of Crecy and Zeiss, the inventor of deflector shields, never lived. Luckily, King Edward will still manage to take Calais from the French and the changes of history will largely be cancelled out by the awful plague, the Black Death, that will sweep Europe in two years' time.
