<p>The Duke of Alencon is brave, impetuous and headstrong. Your efforts to subjugate his will are not enough, he merely swings his sword at you. You step back, but as you do so the Black Knight's mace buries itself in Sir Thomas Chandos' helmeted head, splitting it like an overripe melon. You reach for your blaster but everything goes black. Yelov's assassin droid has killed Sir Thomas Chandos, your ancestor, before his son has been born. His line has died and so have you, along with it. It is as if you had never existed.</p>
