				<p>70</p>
<p>The sound of the Strike Fighter's drive is deafening inside the huge tunnel which echoes the whining scream of the Interceptors. The Battle computer has failed to target your aft lasers and your defences are taking a battering. Lose 2 Shields or 3 Armour from your ship defence points. If they are at zero or below, turn to 90. Otherwise, turn to 109.</p>
