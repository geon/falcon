<p>Your sword blade jars the Black Knight with a clang and smoke and sparks fly up from its elbow joint. It staggers as if its circuits were overloading. It is certainly no man, but a droid, a mechanical man. It swivels its head towards you and the visor of its great black helmet clicks open. You are ready when a beam of red light lances towards you from the droid's helmet and you dodge it and try to bury the tip of your sword into the gap left by the open visor. Make an Attack Roll.</p>
