<p>The G-force dampers work overtime as the Flyer slews drunkenly away from the missiles and you correct its flight path just before impact with the side of a huge iron cooling tower. The missiles slam into the cooling tower, demolishing it completely. Asyoushootpastittowardsthebuildingintowhich the droid flew, an incredible sight meets your gaze. A spaceship almost as large as one of the generation starships of the 24th century isbeingdismantledonahugebrasslandingfield.Asyou fly over it you see a contraption which can only be an enlarged variac drive being hoisted out of its front end. It takes a few secondsfor you to realise what has been happening. The factory droidsmust have manufactured this colossal Time Machine in hours! Hundreds of them hover about it. They must have plannedto invade the Eiger Vault with this machine on Earth, 3033 AD. Now that you have destroyed the Polybdenum and the Timehole on Thrix has closed, Yelov must have altered his plans. As you streak onwards, a daunting vista opens up beneath you. It is Mechanon's space launch field, and it is packed with an interstellar warfleet the size of which defies belief. Row upon row of Interceptors, Ion-drive Battle Cruisers and Atmospheric Fighter-carrying mother-ships glow a burnished bronze beneath the dull red sky. Turn to 133.</p>
