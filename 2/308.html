<p>You explain your best guess as to what Yelov is up to and you do not have to wait long for CAIN to reply. 'The last disturbance registered by the monitoring beacon in the Mechanon timehole occurred after the date and time at which Mechanon historically suffered the nuclear catastrophe. The beacon should have been destroyed by now but it is still live, according to Agent Chameleon. If we assume that Yelov has saved Mechanon he must have a different reason for visiting the planet Thrix.' Where will you set coordinates for?</p>
