				<p>110</p>
<p>You evade the questing beam of the wardroid's laser cannon and return fire at the death machine. The lancing bolt of white-hot energy hits its power plant and your helmet faceplate flash defence cuts in, darkening automatically as the bright explosion lights the yellow atmosphere, hurling debris everywhere. You have destroyed both of the wardroids that guard the loading bay, but other robots may be on their way to intercept you. Turn to 120.</p>
