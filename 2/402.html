<p>As your missile arrows down towards the fortress, you can see several small laser cluster banks swivelling to track it. They open fire, but the missile streaks under the red laser lances and slams into the fortress. There is an enormous explosion and the fortress erupts, sending pieces of twisted metal everywhere. The Strike Fighter is blown upward by the force of the blast, but its gyros correct its course and you rush onward through the smoke and debris like a bullet. Turn to 71.</p>
