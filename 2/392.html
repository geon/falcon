<p>The power of Yelov's mind is almost like that of a god of myth. His insane desire to kill you lends him strength and you are losing this battle of wills. Knowing that it may be the last thing you ever do, you frantically redouble your efforts, but the experience is taking its toll. Subtract I from your Power of Will modifier as he tries to break you. Make a Power of Will Roll.</p>
