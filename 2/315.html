				<p>315</p>
<p>The lasers rake across its nose, destroying the sensitive equipment that the missile carried, but it does not explode. You try electronic counter measures as it closes in on you and it suddenly falls out of the sky. You turn and dive to watch as it screams into a fuel refinery. The explosion flattens factories for a mile around, the shock wave throws you across the sky and a pillar of flame, smoking blackly, reaches far into the atmosphere above you. You fly back towards the gaping maw of the hangar. Turn to 351.</p>
