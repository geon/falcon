<p>Yelov's bionic reactions are even faster than they were before and your heavy-powered battlesuit is comparatively slow. He blocks your blow with his bionic arm and then kicks you in the chest. His machine leg carries enough force and weight to dent your battlesuit. Subtract 2 from your Suit Armour points. The computer suddenly activates a grab used for moving the data banks and Yelov jumps back. You try to dodge as its metal claws close on you. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
