<p>Your will to live pulls you through the terrible battle with the maniac will of Yelov. Sweating with the effort inside your battlesuit, you manage to throw off his attempt to take control of your mind but his mind is as quick as his reflexes and before you can attack him he hurls a blast of mental energy at you. You use your Power of Will to overcome his Thinkstrike which threatens to reduce you to a grovelling animal. Make a Power of Will Roll.</p>
