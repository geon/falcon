<p>Your Strike Fighter re-materialises in the Eiger Vault, 3033 AD. It shows no sign of the damage it suffered on Mechanon. You ask CAIN how long. Earth time, you have been away on the factory planet. To your utter consternation CAIN says it can find no trace of anything called Mechanon in its databanks. You hurry to TIME headquarters to report to Jobanque for your debriefing. When the door to his office slides back he seems surprised to see you. Turn to 420.</p>
