<p>The G-force dampers on your Flyer work overtime as it slews drunkenly out of the path of the missiles. The gyros whine, but one of the missiles passes close enough to you for its computer to decide to detonate. Your Ion Drive is destroyed and you plummet towards the surface of Mechanon. The flyer breaks up on contact but you are flung free, skidding and tumbling for two hundred yards down a polished metal droid highway. Your suit cushions you from the worst but you have lost 6 Endurance points as well as your Flyer. You can only limp onward towards the strange building. Turn to 5.</p>
