<p>You surge upwards through the splintered floormetal with a whine of power. Yelov gropes for his plasma pistol but you are too quick for him. Your particle disruptor drills into his chest and a look of primeval terror crosses his face as his very being pours out of him in a stream of atoms. Within seconds he has been spread in a thin coat all over the Central Computer. There is nothing left to show the world that you have defeated the greatest villain of all time. Turn to 361.</p>
