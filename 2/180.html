<p>CAIN opens a holo-link to Jobanque's office. Your new section leader is in deep thought, but looks up at you as you ask your question. 'I shall wait until you have decided your first move before I deploy the SAT Squad. I may send Bloodhound and Lynx to Mechanon if we do not hear from you within four hours, but I don't believe in letting everyone loose on the Timelines at once - there's no telling what might happen if two operatives are active within the same Timehole without knowing that a colleague is busy there too.'</p>
<p>You nod. 'I'm on my own then?' you ask.</p>
<p>Jobanque smiles, To begin with, at least. You'll survive, Falcon.'</p>
<p>You instruct CAIN to break the holo-link and ask it for more information.</p>
