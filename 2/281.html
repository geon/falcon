<p>You pull up and roll the Strike Fighter 90 degrees, presenting as little of it as possible, but you are too slow and it slams into you, filling your forward screens with a great ball of burning plasma The force of the explosion almost shakes the ship apart and you lose control of her for a moment. Incredibly, she withstands the blast itself. Lose 2 Shield or \ Armour point. If y o u r ship defence points have fallen below zero, turn to 90. If not , you streak on over the fortress. Turn to 71.</p>
