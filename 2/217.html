<p>The laser cannon nicks your leg and the corrosive gas of Thrix's atmosphere pours into your environment suit. Your leg has been almost severed, but the suit's plasnet repairs itself automatically. You lose 10 Endurance points. If you are still alive, your leg will heal badly, and you must remove one from your Endurance maximum forever. Turn to 228.</p>
