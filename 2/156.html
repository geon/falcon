<p>The revving whine of a hovbike sounds behind you. You whirl found to see Clone, lowlifer leader of the hovbike gang that tried to kill you for sport in a dead-end alley of Old Geneva. He has shaven off all but two spiking tufts of his gold-metal hair but he wears the same patchwork of robot parts and sharpened flanges that he did then. The ram-fronted hovbike rears and he slips neatly off its back as it roars towards you. A lesser human would have been caught by the hovbike and crushed, but you spin aside and it hurtles past, collapsing into a set of wrought- iron park railings. 'You owe me, mutie upper,' Clone shouts madly. 'Your mindgames have made me a no-life. I've only one thing left, Falcon, I'm not a street'roid any more, I just want to kill you.' A crowd of passers-by gathers and it irritates you that they stare at you as least as much as the outlandishly garbed madman. You decide to drop him, using your powers of Thinkstrike.He crumples senseless to the floor, a look of resigned rage upon his face, and you hand him over to the two Citpol Enforcers who have just arrived on the scene in a jetcopter. They take Clone away, after sedating him, and you walk on into the park. The incident has unnerved you unaccountably and you are unable to relax. Turn to 167.</p>
