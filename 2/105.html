<p>You re-materialise high above a green world circled with bands of white cloud. You guide your Strike Fighter towards the largest city that you can see as you skim the rolling hills and plains of Danikos. CAIN says you have been detected but your radar, although covered in moving blips, does not show any aircraft moving to intercept you. You finally set your Fighter down in a sandy square. All of the buildings that you have seen so far look like the palaces of times still to come on Earth. Each is overburdened with exquisitely complicated carvings and ornamental turrets and domes. A small crowd gathers - the Danikoi are spindly, tall humanoids with sparkling eyes of gold, without iris or pupil. They have no body hair. There are no weapons in sight and you blow the hatch seal and step out. You approach the crowd who show no fear despite your formidable array of weaponry and the outlandish whine of your power suit. Your translator synthesises your speech as a metallic humming when you ask to be taken to their decision makers. There is a ripple of humming laughter and one of them invites you to a party instead, but eventually you manage to convince them to do as you ask. Turn to 222.</p>
