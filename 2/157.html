<p>The wardroid moves faster than you and the beam of its laser cannon knifes into your side, removing an inch of bone and flesh from your hip and thigh. The plasnet of your suit reseals itself automatically, but not before the corrosive yellow gas of the Thrixian atmosphere leaks in and contaminates your wound. Lose 10 Endurance points. If you are still alive, the wound will heal poorly, deduct one from your maximum Endurance forever. Carborundum causes the door of the furnace to fly open and a river of molten slag engulfs both it and the droid. The wardroid's melting point is below that of the lava and it subsides into a molten mass. The Thrix is untroubled by this extreme temperature - is Carborundum indestructible, you wonder? Turn to 181.</p>
