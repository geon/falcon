<p>Yelov's plasma pistol rips into your battlesuit, twisting and rupturing its armour, and you lose 10 Endurance points as the plasma gets through to your midriff. If you are still alive, you recover, but the speed with which Yelov now rushes you shows that both of his legs are bionic. He is having himself transformed into a walking death machine. He punches you with his bionic arm which is twenty times as powerful as any man's. You hurtle backwards and smash into a computer terminal. Subtract \ from your Suit Armour. If your armour is at zero or less, turn to 161. Otherwise, the computer screams at Yelov not to hurt it. Turn to 56.</p>
