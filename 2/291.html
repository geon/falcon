				<p>291</p>
<p>Your thumb presses down on the joystick firing buttons, but you acted too soon and the twin beams disintegrate a set of sensor banks. You have no time to do anything before two plasma shells explode on your front shields with an awful crackling roar. Your ship is engulfed in a great ball of white plasma. The heat is unbearable and you look up in horror to see your front screens filling with three missiles. They slam into the ship, ripping the hull open. You are consumed in a massive explosion. You have failed.</p>
