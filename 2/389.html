<p>As you survey the battle from the height of the King's position the withering volleys of the English longbowmen take their toll again and again, bringing down ranks of knights and horses as if they had ridden into a wall. Some of the valiant French knights break through and there is fierce hand-to-hand fighting around the Black Prince's position. As you watch, a huge English knight in black armour who bears no coat of arms raises his mace against one of his fellows. The great blow falls and you are engulfed in darkness. One of your ancestors has been slain - it is as if you had never existed. Now Agidy Yelov will rule the Federation.</p>
