<p>Falcon's Wing rematerialises on Mechanon, which is a gleaming orb of polished metals. Robo-factories stretch as far as the eye can see, covering every inch of the planet's surface, almost without light in the sombre red sky. At three mile intervals around you are what must be planetary defence points: bronze domes bristling with some sort of surface-to-space artillery. Your scanners indicate that nothing lives on this dead world, not even grass, but it is alive with bizarrely-shaped droids which dart and scuttle across its face like insects. You decide to explore on foot and set out towards a building which glows a ghostly green. You move swiftly but are not far enough from Falcon's Wing to escape the blast of an incoming missile. You are hurled through the air and smash into the base of a huge iron cooling tower as Falcon's Wing is blown to smithereens. As you regain consciousness and realise that you are trapped in time on Mechanon, all goes dark. Your ancestor has been killed at the Battle of Crecy on Earth in 1346 AD. It is as if you had never existed. You have failed.</p>
