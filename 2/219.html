<p>The Main Access portal is an oval opening, a hundred metres across and fifty high. It seems to be composed of ten overlapping sections of metal which can slide open one at a time or all together. As you hurtle towards it a swarm of Atmospheric Interceptors appear from the hangar opening. Their pulse lasers will soon be wreaking havoc on your ship's defences. To blast your way through the Main Access portal, will you use:</p>
<p>A missile?</p>
<p>Your twin fusion beams?</p>
