<p>CAIN replies that the technology possessed by the decadent Danikoi who programmed the self-replicating droids which turned Mechanon into one great factory was at least as advanced as that possessed by a member of the Space Federation in 3033 AD. The fearsome array of space weapons made by these machines is the most deadly arsenal the galaxy has ever seen. This arsenal includes potent nuclear devices, floating fortress platforms and spaceships which are all vast robots. Mechanon is itself heavily defended by Atmospheric Interceptors, intruder detection satellite droids and wardroids with missile or energy weapon strongpoints all over the surface. They are also able to manufacture new droids, weapons, ships etc for any purpose within hours. Turn to 273.</p>
