<p>The tip of the French knight's lance catches your shield near the top, causing it to tip backwards. The lance rides up over the shield and bores into your chest, tearing through the chain mail corselet, as if it were paper. Lose 8 Endurance points as you are thrown to the ground by the momentum of his charge. You stagger to your feet, thankful that the armour CAIN prepared for you is lighter than the real thing, as the knight throws down his lance and, reining in, draws his blade, intent on finishing you. Turn to 173.</p>
