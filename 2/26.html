<p>As you step out of the recreation centre your Remote Access T erminal bleeps and CAIN sends you a message. The android is hooking into the telephone network and changing the informationreaching the Communist bloc defence computer which controls nearly half of the world's nuclear missiles at this time. You scale a wall and enter a courtyard in which there is a red and glass booth. The android is inside and you recognise an ancient 'tele'phone in its hand. He has fitted an unusual device to the transmitter. Will you:</p>
<p>Climbback over the wall and cut the cable which leads to the telephone booth?</p>
<p>Walk to the booth and yank the android out of it?</p>
<p>Use your blaster on the android?</p>
