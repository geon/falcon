<p>You blast just in time, hitting the power plant of the wardroid. Your faceplate reacts instantly, cutting in the flash damper, and it darkens as a bright explosion lights up the interior of the machinery of the refining plant. Carborundum is not so lucky. The armour-piercing missile shatters his rocky shell, pouring molten copper into his sound chambers which then explode. A terrible keening fills the air as the Thrix dies and the sonic vibrations crack your faceplate. The acid gas of the Thrixian atmosphere invades your suit and you die horribly as it dissolves your eyes and face. You have failed.</p>
