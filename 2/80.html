<p>You tell them that you have useful information to be analysed at the Eiger Vault and agree to leave Mechanon before you are all killed. They tell you that Falcon's Wing has been destroyed and you are forced to ask for passage back to the Vault. You make your way back to their machines at a run and your combined firepower is enough to dispose of the four wardroids which attack, but Bloodhound is wounded when you are 'buzzed' by three strafing Atmospheric Interceptors. Lynx is glad to allow you the use of her autodoc and you take a relaxant and recuperate. You may restore up to 12 points of lost Endurance. Turn to 102.</p>
