<p>You tell them that you have useful information to be analysed at the Eiger Vault and agree to leave Mechanon before you are all destroyed. The Time Machines of Bloodhound and Lynx are not far from Falcon's Wing; you make your way back at a run. Your combined firepower is enough to dispose of the two wardroids which cross your path, but Bloodhound is wounded when you are 'buzzed' by three strafing Atmospheric Interceptors. The three Time Machines wink out together and you head straight for your Autodoc for a relaxant and to recuperate. You may restore up to 12 points of lost Endurance points. Turn to 91.</p>
