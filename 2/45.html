<p>You step through the back door of the ancient recreation centre and into the courtyard. The android is inside a red and glass booth - you recognise an ancient 'tele'phone in his hand and he has fitted an unusual device to the transmitter. Your Remote Access Terminal bleeps and CAIN sends you a message. The android is hooking into the telephone network and changing the information reaching the Communist bloc defence computer which controls nearly half of the world's nuclear missiles at this lime. While you are reading the message on your small wrist display the android has noticed you and recognises you for what you are. It is aiming a stun blaster at you. Duck! Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
