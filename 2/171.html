<p>The interceptor is nimble and it swerves just enough to cause your fission beams to miss before gunning its pulse lasers into you. If your Strike Fighter carries Zeiss Deflector Shields they withstand the pulse laser, unharmed. If not your Titanium Hull Armour has taken 1 point of damage. If your Hull Armour is at zero points, turn to 208. If not, you manage to bring the interceptor into your sights once again. Turn to 159.</p>
