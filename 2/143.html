<p>Jobanque tells you to rest until the Weeks/Senior Corporation Strike Fighter is ready. You decide to take the hovrail to the leisure park. Alpolis hums with activity, news of Yelov's escape has been suppressed to avoid mass hysteria. You stroll leisurely towards the old style iron gates of the leisure park with its live sheep. Did you visit the low life area of Old Geneva and encounter a hovbike gang when on a mission to find the Renegade Lord?</p>
