<p>The Main Access portal is an oval opening, a hundred metres across and fifty tall. It seems to be composed of ten overlapping sections of metal which can slide open one at a time or all together. As you hurtle towards it a swarm of Atmospheric Interceptorsappear from the hangar opening. Their pulse lasers will soon be wreaking havoc on your ship's defences. Quickly you beam the Main Access Code at the Communication Tower above the portal and it slides open. You move from the gloomy brooding red of Mechanon's thin atmosphere to the ghostly green luminescence which lights an enormous tunnel that stretches ahead for miles. Ten Atmospheric Interceptors follow you down the tunnel, their pulse lasers winking on and off as they pour their deathly fire at your ship's defences. Turn to 109.</p>
