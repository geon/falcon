				<p>329</p>
<p>Your rocket hits the interceptor which explodes with a roar and a clang as half of it cannons into the side of the tunnel. The hunter-seeker fixes itself onto the back of your battlesuit. Warning lights flash as the suit's sensors tell you that the hunter-seeker is an armour piercing device. A controlled explosion forces a core of molten metal through the suit and you explode inside it when it drills into your body. The last sound you hear is Yelov's vengeful howl of joy.</p>
