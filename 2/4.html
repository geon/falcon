<p>Your training has paid off. Faster even than the electronic circuitry of the wardroid, the lancing bolt of white hot energy hits its power plant and your helmet faceplate flash defence cuts in, darkening automatically as the bright explosion lights the yellow atmosphere, hurling debris everywhere. You have destroyed the wardroid that guards the loading bay but other robots may be on their way to intercept you. A rack of Polybdenum rods stands in the bay at the back of the cavernous armadillo-like mining droid. You seize your chance to destroy it. Turn to 141.</p>
