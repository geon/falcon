				<p>73</p>
<p>Yelov leaps aside and takes cover behind a bank of electronic machinery. You step towards it but the computer opens a hatchway beneath your feet and you fall through it. You blast with your jetpack but the hatchway closes, trapping you at the neck. The floor starts to buckle under the surge of the jets and you pound the floor with your power suited fists, but Yelov has found his plasma pistol and it demolishes your helmet. You are blinded and cannot see Yelov sneer evilly as he disintegrates your head.</p>
