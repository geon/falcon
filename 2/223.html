<p>Falcon's Wing settles onto the rocky surface of Thrix with a crunch and a whine from its hydraulic legs. CAIN warns you that the soupy, yellow atmosphere of Thrix is highly corrosive, so you put on your environment suit. The inhabitants of this world live for many thousands of years and are composed almost entirely of glass, like silica. They are telepathic and can also move objects by thought alone. The camera shows ghostly outcroppings of jagged rock, swimming in soupy gases. Soon after you have stepped outside, the gases seem to thicken into a fog and you are forced to halt until visibility improves. Just as you catch sight of a huge machine bristling with weaponry, everything goes black. Your ancestor has been killed at the Battle of Crecy on Earth in 1346 AD. It is as if you had never existed. You have failed.</p>
