<p>Three times the French knight's sword rings loudly on your shield with bludgeoning force. You are driven to your knees under the weight of his attack, but the English knights have courageously beaten back the French and their ranks close once more. Your assailant is trapped and, realising the hopelessness of his position, he decides, instead of killing you, to surrender to you in the hope of being ransomed. You shake your head and move your aching shield arm gingerly as he is led away. An esquire calls that he is the prize of the unknown knight whose arms are 'Argent, a Chevron Gules', the colours of your shield. As the numbness leaves your arm, you look about you to gauge the flow of battle. Turn to 162.</p>
