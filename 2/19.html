<p>You move deeper into the complex to radio your direction to Bloodhound and Lynx before switching on the homing signal in your environment suit. As you move along yet another vast tunnel the ceiling opens up and a hover platform descends towards you. You flatten yourself against the wall, but it carries only worker droids. As you watch they open a hatch in the tunnel wall and load a fifty-metre long starship Ion Drive onto the platform. The platform rises again and the ceiling is sealed once more. Lynx radios you to hold your position if at all possible. Three hovering wardroids and a raildroid appear at the far end of this tunnel and you are about to report that you must retreat when the ceiling opens once more. Bloodhound lowers a rope to you and they pull you up just as the green rays of a particle disrupter sheer into the luminous wall behind you. The raildroid aims again as you reach for the gap in the ceiling. Make an Evasion Roll as you try to scramble through to the planet surface.</p>
