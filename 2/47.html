<p>Falcon's Wing rematerialises on Mechanon, which is a gleaming orb of polished metals. Robo-factories stretch as far as the eye can see, covering every inch of the planet's surface, almost without light in the sombre red sky. At three mile intervals around you are what must be planetary defence points: bronze domes bristling with some sort of surface-to-space artillery. Your scanners indicate that nothing lives on this dead world, not even grass, but it is alive with bizarrely-shaped droids which dart and scuttle across its face like insects. You decide to explore on foot and set out towards a building which glows a ghostly green. The bustling machines ignore you until you approach what looks like an enormous spaceship. The spacecraft suddenly disappears and you realise, horror-struck, that the droids of Mechanon have built an enormous Time Machine. You race back to Falcon's Wing but when you re-emerge in the Eiger Vault you are already too late. Wardroids are destroying everything and their Time Machine winks out to load up with reinforcements. The wardroids of Mechanon have invaded Earth in 3033 AD and there is nothing you can do to stop them conquering the world. The beam of a particle disruptor spreads you thinly across the shell of Falcon's Wing. You have failed.</p>
