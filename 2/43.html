<p>You are too slow. The Thrix causes the pebbles beneath your feet to shift and you are powerless to stop the rock as it smashes against your faceplate, cracking it. The yellow gas seeps into your suit and begins to eat away at your skin and lungs. Helpless, you can do nothing as the twenty ton Thrix rolls over you, pressing you flatter than a leaf. You have failed.</p>
