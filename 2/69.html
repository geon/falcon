<p>Your fusion beam flashes past the missile but lances into the missile base, destroying it totally. Its last missile is almost upon you - your hand whips out to the ECM controls, but it is too late. the missile completely fills the scanner screen as it hits you head on and there is a great blast that rocks the ship, stopping it almost dead in its tracks. Lose 2 points of Shields or 3 points of Armour. If your ship's defences are at zero or below all of the circuits overload, turn to 276. If they are not, you accelerate away. Turn to 20.</p>
