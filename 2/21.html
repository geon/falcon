<p>They follow you to your Strike Fighter and it quickly becomes obvious that they believe your story. The hums of amazement grow and they are taking in every detail. After a time one of them, a physicist, says that he believes he could duplicate the Variac Drive. You push them away from it but it is too late. They wander off, ignoring you, but the Disputer says, 'Have no fear, we are not an aggressive race. With this Drive we can make sure than no disasters ever occur.' There is nothing that you can do now which will stop the Danikoi using Time Travel to mould history to their own decadent whims. Suddenly, everything goes dark. The Danikoi have changed history and it is as if you and the Space Federation had never existed.</p>
