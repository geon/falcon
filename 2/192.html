<p>You hurtle onward like a bullet. After a few moments you see an enormous missile launcher ahead. Obviously the one that launched the missile as big as your Strike Fighter and it is armed and ready again. With a shuddering roar the huge missile pulls away from the launcher and accelerates towards you. You have no time to turn and it completely fills your screen. In desperation you fire your fission beam but to no avail. The missile erupts and its explosive force is doubled in this enclosed space. Your hull is breached and the tunnel collapses around you. A tangled mess of metal and rock will be your tomb for ever. You have failed.</p>
