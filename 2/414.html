<p>Shutting all other thoughts out you concentrate on exerting your will to control the Black Knight, but there is no will to control inside the menacing suit of armour. You realise with horror it is an automaton, not a man. You are too late to halt the descent of the crackling blue mace and Sir Thomas Chandos is bathed in electricity as the force of the blow pulps his helmeted head like an overripe melon. The automaton turns towards you, raising its mace, but suddenly you are engulfed in darkness. Sir Thomas Chandos was your ancestor and he has not yet sired the son whose line comes down to you. Y elov has sent a special droid to kill your ancestor and he has killed you too for it is as if you had never existed.</p>
