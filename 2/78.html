<p>The Thrix seems unperturbed by the knowledge that you tried to harm it. Apparently it can withstand the most extreme temperatures and ionic disturbances. It tells you that a mining complex has recently appeared on the planet, a complex as alien to it as you are, and it offers to lead you to it. You decide to follow warily when, out of the gloom, a red light appears ahead of you. A great metal monster comes towards you out of the fog. It has four hover-thruster discs, and it is heavily armoured. It is equipped with an awesome array of weaponry - an Ion Beam discharge, mortar cluster, laser cannon mountings, high explosive machine rifles and the like. It is aiming a laser cannon at you - you have no choice but to blast it. The superheated plasma fuses its metal shell and it explodes with a roar, before it can fire. The Thrix registers pleasure at your action and you continue through the fog together. Turn to 53.</p>
