<p>You are still not familiar with the Strike Fighter's beam laser controls and you have failed to stop the missiles. AH three home in and detonate. The ship rocks and the gyros whir as it rights itself. Your hull armour or shields have saved you from certain destruction, but your ship has taken damage.
