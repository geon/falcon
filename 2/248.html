<p>CAIN replies that all traces of Polybdenum were mined out of Mechanon for use in wardroids centuries ago. Yelov's machine like yours, carried enough Polybdenum to use the Variac Drive for eight jumps through time and space. If Yelov needs Polybdenum then Thrix is the obvious place to go for it - the planet Thrix has the richest seams of Polybdenum-Iridium ore yet discovered. Turn to 273.</p>
