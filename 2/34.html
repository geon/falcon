<p>As you approach the Central Computer Complex, which glows a ghostly luminescent green, in the midst of the dull red expanse of metal, you enter a freak ion storm. CAIN tells you that the ion storm renders his detection scanners useless. If the same is true for the scanners fitted to the wardroids you may be able to fly right into the complex undetected, but you will have to rely on sight alone to navigate. You slow to Mach 4 and dive down into the storm. Just as you begin to pull out, fearing that you may hit the top of a cooling tower or energy pylon, you burst out of the storm. The polished metal of the launch field glints redly beneath and the warfleet has not yet been launched against Earth. You slow further and line yourself up for the hangar entrance into the glowing green Central Computer Complex. Turn to 257.</p>
