<p>As soon as you arrive back in the Eiger Vault CAIN tells you that Jobanque is waiting in the research section to debrief you. With Bloodhound and Lynx, you walk briskly to meet him. He is in the office of the head of the research section of TIME, Skirrow, the man who, in his younger days as a space rover, discovered Planet Hel and Skirrow's World. He is a stocky man with red gold hair and he welcomes you cordially. You make a full report to Jobanque who nods pensively throughout. Skirrow takes your universal Interface to unscramble the information it now holds. By the time you have finished telling your story of the horrors of Mechanon, a story which Lynx and Bloodhound confirm, Skirrow has returned with a holo-readout. He confers with Jobanque and they swiftly reach agreement as to the next course of action. Skirrow tells you that you have successfully tapped the data-banks of the Command Computer on Mechanon. 'It is named after Zordekai, the Danikoi who designed it. It seems that, since you have stopped Yelov and the wardroids moving through time to attack the Space Federation in 3033 AD, they are planning to attack Earth, using starship droids, in 1986 AD.'</p>
<p>Jobanque says, 'You, and you alone, must stop them before they take off, Falcon. Skirrow will explain why you must go on without support.' You follow Skirrow to the top secret research laboratory, which is in total darkness.</p>
