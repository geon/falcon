<p>The Disputer turns from you and confers with the others. Some are saying that it will cost them nothing to make a law against the building of a factory planet. Another says that if they are not concerned with the future it doesn't matter if they do anyway This amuses them and they turn to you and say that you can have your wish. A law is typed into the computer as you watch You know that their society can only exist without enforcement and weapons because they never break their laws. You have done all you can and you decide to leave before they think to steal the secret of time travel by examining your Strike Fighter. Turn to 376.</p>
