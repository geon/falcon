<p>You are unable to shake it off. It homes in on you; its image completely fills the scanner screen as it hits you head on. There is a sickening lurch and a horrifying explosion but you cannot believe it when, a second later, you are still alive. Evidently the defences of your Weeks/Senior Strike Fighter almost defy belief. There is damage, however, you have lost 4 points from your Energy Shields or 7 points from your Titanium Hull Armour. If your ship's defences are at zero or below all of the circuits overload. Turn to 282. If they are not, you accelerate away, the impact has stopped you dead. Turn to 351.</p>
