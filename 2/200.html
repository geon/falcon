<p>There is a great ringing of steel, and sparks fly as the swords of Count Louis and Sir Thomas meet. The Frenchman is tall and powerful, but Sir Thomas is the more skilful and he turns the Count's sword before burying his own deep in the Frenchman's side. Count Louis falls to the ground, dead, as Chandos searches, panting for breath and peering through the narrow slit of his visor, for a new opponent. Suddenly, you see an English knight in black armour whose shield bears no device but is as black as sable. He is raising his mace to strike Sir Thomas Chandos and it seems to crackle with a blue aura. You cannot detect any thought at all inside the great black helm. Will you:</p>
<p>Use your Power of Will on the Black Knight?</p>
<p>Attack the Black Knight with your sword?</p>
