<p>You make it over the wall but as you set off down the tarmac strip towards your Strike Fighter you are blinded by the sudden flare of the searchlights of a machine called a car for a moment before your flash dampers cut in. Two more men in blue uniforms get out and one of them manages to hurl himself at you so that you lose your footing and fall to the ground. He is on top of you and you decide to use your Power of Will. Make a Power of Will Roll.</p>
