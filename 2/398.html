<p>You sprint away from Falcon's Wing as three ballistic missiles streak overhead. Two score direct hits on your Time Machine and the blast hurls you fifty feet across the gleaming steel roof of the refining plant. Lose 2 Endurance points. The third missile destroys the mining droid, sending a purple cloud of atomised rock into the atmosphere. When the dust settles all that remains of Falcon's Wing is a few small parts of one of the hydraulic legs. You are trapped in time, on Mechanon in 1986 AD with no way of leaving this soulless planet dedicated to the manufacture of hideous weaponry. You have no choice but to go on. Turn to 5.</p>
