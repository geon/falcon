<p>You open fire again and this time your plasma beam fuses the wardroid's gun mountings, allowing you to play your beam over it for some time. The yellow gas turns red in a great cloud around it as the metal of the droid fuses and collapses in on itself, into a molten mass. It carried a radar beacon which has now stopped functioning. You can see four more of the hovering wardroids, one at each corner of the gargantuan mining droid and you realise it will not be long before they register that the droid which attacked you is out of action. At the back of the mining droid is a loading bay stacked with thin rods of ore. You creep across the rocky terrain towards the loading bay. Turn to 252.</p>
