<p>The questing beam of the wardroid's laser cannon brushes your side, shaving an inch of flesh and bone off your leg and hip. The plasnet of your ruptured suit repairs itself but the awful wound is contaminated by the acid gas of Thrix. Lose 11 Endurance points. If you are still alive, the wound will heal badly - remove 1 from your maximum Endurance scon forever. You return fire at the immobile death machine. The lancing bolt of white hot energy hits its power plant and your helmet faceplate flash defence cuts in, darkening automatically as the bright explosion lights the yellow atmosphere, hurling debris everywhere. You have destroyed both of the wardroids that guard the loading bay but other robots may be on their way to intercept you. Turn to 120.</p>
