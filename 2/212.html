<p>You fire twice on the run, immobilising one of the wardroids which crashes to the ground, but missing the other. A pulse of energy from the weapon banks of the second droid hurls you against the rocky remains of a dead Thrix. Your suit is ruptured. Lose 10 Endurance points. The wounds will heal badly - subtract 1 from your maximum Endurance points permanently. If you are still alive, you roll aside and blast again. Your aim is true and you have destroyed the other wardroid's hover pads. It falls to the ground with an impact that shakes the rock like an earthquake and explodes scattering lumps of corroded metal everywhere. The immobile wardroid is preparing to open up at you with its laser cannon - you have an instant in which to dodge the beam and destroy the droid. You evade the questing beam of the wardroid's laser cannon and return fire at the immobile death machine. The lancing bolt of white-hot energy hits its power plant, hurling debris everywhere and your helmet faceplate flash defence cuts in, darkening automatically as the bright explosion lights the yellow atmosphere. CAIN radios you to say that the timehole on Thrix is closing and you run to Falcon's Wing. Turn to 284.</p>
