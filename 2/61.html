<p>You regain the safety of Falcon's Wing, suffering no more than the mockery of some camp followers who think that you are fleeing the battle in fear. CAIN tells you that his scanners registered the fact that the Black Knight was a droid from Mechanon, and that it must have been programmed to kill Sir Thomas Chandos who is probably your ancestor. 'Be careful, Falcon, Yelov is trying to kill you.' If you didn't know that electronic brains are not programmed to register emotion CAIN's tone would have you believe he was worried on your behalf. You can see on the console screen that the battle is continuing. The Black Prince is alive, another horse between his knees, and his standard has been raised once more. The camera roomsin on the leader of yet another French charge. CAIN tells you t h a t the man in the visor-less helmet tied to two other knights who are leading his horse into battle is King John the Blind of Bohemia. Once again the French charge is broken by the English archers and is thrown back. You can see the blind king lying dead on the field, still tied to his brave knights. It is already dusk and the English have almost won the day. There is nothing more for you to do here in Mediaeval France. Turn to 194.</p>
