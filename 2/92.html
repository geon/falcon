<p>You whip out your blaster and fire with the consummate skill of one who has scored MAX in the sim-combat booths three times running. The telephone booth and the android erupt in a small explosion but a piece of twisted metal crashes against your helmet so hard that you fall stunned. Lose 3 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you regain your senses to the sound of a siren, like that of an Enforcer's jetcopter nearby, and two men in navy blue uniforms run towards you from the recreation centre. Still groggy, you can jump for the wall and try to scramble over before they catch you. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>
