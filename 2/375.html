				<p>375</p>
<p>Too late you realise that the twenty space-artillery cannons are trained towards you. They fire simultaneously and twenty plasma bolts explode all around you. Your ship's defences, incredibly, stand up to this battering, but they are almost useless now. You scream into the cavernous tunnel and two raildroids whir along their raits towards you. You score a hit on one but the particle disrupter beam of the other pierces your defences. The Strike Fighter is consumed in a ball of flame as its drive overloads and you are destroyed with it. You have failed.</p>
