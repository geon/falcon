<p>Before you can fire, one of the wardroids fires four shells from a mortar-cluster housing. They pepper the ground all around and explode, tumbling you through the air and tearing a hole in your environment suit. The suit's plasnet repairs itself but some of the acid atmosphere of Thrix is trapped inside and it reaches your lungs before your suit flushes it out. Lose 12 Endurance points. If you are still alive, the wounds will heal badly. Subtract 1 from your maximum Endurance forever. You pick yourself up again and decide to shoot on the run this time. Turn to 382.</p>
