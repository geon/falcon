<p>The android has turned its blaster to maximum and its beam sears into you. Lose 9 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you roll out of the beam and then unleash the energy of your blaster, taking even the superhuman android by surprise. You play the beam across it until it is completely vapourised and then set off across the countryside in search of your Strike Fighter. Turn to 135.</p>
