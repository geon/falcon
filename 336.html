		<table>
			
						<tr>
							<td>Try to follow Lord Speke into the past?</td>
							<td><a href="357.html">Turn to 357</a></td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Follow Lord Kirik to Kelados, 3033 AD?</td>
							<td><a href="284.html">Turn to 284</a></td>
						</tr>

						<tr>
							<td>Ask CAIN where Silvermane is?</td>

						<tr>
							<td>Quickly contact Lord Pilota by holophone?</td>
							<td><a href="331.html">Turn to 331</a></td>
