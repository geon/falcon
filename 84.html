<p>For ten minutes you race through the confusion of the battlefield towards your Time Machines as the Imperial Guard approach the Russians. It is too late to call off the attack now. MarshalNey has flung his men at the Russians, confident of success now that he has reinforcements. Unfortunately, your ancestor, the young hussar, is killed leading the charge and all goes black. He will never have the son who would have carried on the bloodline which leads to you. It is as if you had never existed. You have failed.</p>
