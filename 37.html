<p>The Emperor, bewildered by the mental attacks of the Creche, falls easily under your control. You force him to give the order which recalls the Imperial Guard and the attack does not take place. Deprived of reinforcements, Marshal Ney does not fling his men into another attack and both sides,exhausted, are reduced to the occasional cannonade. The Frenchhave won, but it is not a decisive victory. Thirty thousand Frenchmen are dead or wounded;the Russians have lost tenthous and more.</p>
<p>The battlefield is strewn with the dead and dying and they are piled in mounds around the redoubts. You have made sure that history is not changed and you decide to return to Falcon's Wing and follow the Creche to the planet Hel, Turn to 161.</p>
