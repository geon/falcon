Soon you are sitting in the familiar confines of Falcon's Wing, running through the systems check and activating CAIN. Immediately its metallic chimes fill the cabin: 'Welcome aboard once again, Falcon. Perhaps on this mission you will not behave in the usual erratic and emotional way common to all organic forms of life!' After threatening to pull the plug on CAIN you ask it if there is any information on offer:'Of course, Falcon, am I not the world's finest computer? In fact, there is some new data from the new Section Chief of the Monitoring Section, PoLing. A disturbance in the timelines has been noted in the timehole currently active in North America, Earth, in the year 1863. There was a civil war in America at that time, Falcon. It is also possible to narrow your search down to only four timeholes. Other agents, mainly on monitoring duties, have found no evidence to suggest there has been any tampering in any of the others,' and CAIN displays the information on the screens. Where will you search for Baal, the so-called DemonLord:

South America, Earth, 1409 AD - the time of the Aztecs?
North America, Earth, 1863 AD - the time of the American Civil War?
Rigel Prime, 1642 AD?
The Earth Colony on the Planet Dustbowl, 2764 AD?

You hurl yourself flat on the floor, as a volley of small javelins fly from the wall to your left, whistling overhead to clatter against the far wall. Heaving a sigh of relief, you get to your feet. Will you:

Step on to the slab directly in front of you, still close to the left wall?
Step on to the slab directly to your right, still on the front row?
Step diagonally to the right, onto the centremost slab of the nine?

A river of white-hot plasma envelops the fly being. There is a burbling shriek before the creature shrivels up like burning paper and drops with a wet slap to the floor of the warehouse. Realising the rest of the followers of Baal may be here soon you disappear into the hologram of the crate and are drawn up into Falcon's Wing. Turn to 23.

The first 'priest' drops senseless. The other two hesitate at this, but charge on. You Thinkstrike another, who also collapses. The last hurls his dagger before turning tail and running in panic, not sure whether his comrades are unconscious or dead. You are caught on the hop and the dagger gashes your thigh. Lose 3 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you continue on. Turn to 416.

5
You set co-ordinates for Earth in 3033 AD and you are soon surrounded by the grey nothingness of null-space. You may lie in your Autodoc and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance points during the journey. You rematerialise in the Eiger Vault and whilst a TIME maintenance team replenishes Falcon Wing's supply of polybdenum, you instruct CAIN to link up with the Eiger Service computer to check for any news. CAIN reports that nothing new has occurred during your visit to Gettysburg. You will have to continue your search unaided. Which timehole will you travel to:

Rigel Prime, in 1642 AD, if you have not been there already?
South America, Earth, 1409 AD, the time of the Aztecs, if you have not been there already?
The colony Planet, Dustbowl, in the year 2764 AD, if you have not been there already?

CAIN chimes: 'I have disguised your Time Machine as an adobe house; fortunately no organic life forms were nearby to witness its sudden appearance. We have arrived in Tenochtitlan, the great capital city of the Aztec Empire, Falcon. Its population has been estimated in hundreds of thousands which makes it one of the largest cities in the world at this time. The current 'Uei Tlatoan, or Emperor, is Ahuitzotl, a cruel and vicious tyrant. His son was Moctezuma II, who was Emperor when the Spaniards, along with smallpox, all but wiped out this civilisation and its people. The Aztecs practised a brutal religion, requiring mass human sacrifice, and, after, the consumption of the victim's flesh. Indeed, wars called 'Flowery Wars' were often fought between nations for no reason other than to garner prisoners for sacrifice. Ahuitzotl was responsible for the sacrifice of 20,000 defeated victims in one day, in this very year.' You ask CAIN to run off a suitable set of clothes for you in the Molecular Converter. Soon you are dressed in the clothing of what CAIN tells you is one of the two elite military orders in the Aztec Empire, the Eagle Knights. The other is the Jaguar Knights. You are wearing a fantastic headress of white eagle feathers, a quilted patterned jacket, and a brightly coloured skirt adorned with feathers, with copper anklets and bracelets. Your weapon is a wooden club inlaid with sharp flints of obsidian. You tuck your blaster under the jacket.

You materialise on the world of Dustbowl again. Examining the camera you see that you have not arrived within the domed city of Refuge this time, but at the port, on the edge of the Sea of Dust. This should mean that the priests of Baal will probably be unable to detect your presence. Crates and miscellaneous equipment are stacked nearby and to the left you can see a cluster of buildings. It is day time, and the white sun is directly overhead; the sky is maroon tinged with blue, and the air is filled with clouds of fine dust. Ahead of you stretches an endless red expanse, the Sea of Dust. Behind you and to either side, great rocky cliffs climb high above you, stretching out of sight. Perched somewhere at their top lies the city of Refuge. CAIN runs off the disguise of a Dustbowl whaler in the Molecular Convertor again, along with a filter mask and you step out, detector in hand. You look around, but no one is near. Setting the tripod up, you begin to explore its psychic emanations. You sense that it is registering the presence of a piece of the Rack! Your excitement fades though as you realise that it is lying out at sea, deep in the depths of the crater, buried under tons and tons of dust. It will prove difficult to get hold of. You decide to consult CAIN, and re-enter Falcon's Wing. Turn to 27.

'Come on,' you shout and you both set off in pursuit of Yelov. He pulls away from you however, his bionic legs giving him an added advantage. Soldiers stare at you as you run past, thinking you are couriers with urgent messages. Soon you are past Benner's Hill, coming to orderly lines of Confederate men, tired but still alert. Lynx tells you this is Early's division, the Confederate troops nearest to Culp's Hill. You veer away from them, not wishing to draw any enquiries as to where you are going. You see Yelov crossing a small river or brook and disappearing into the woods around Culp's Hill, noticing that he is now in a blue uniform. You move forward towards the wood. Suddenly a line of blue jacketed infantrymen step into the open at the edge of the wood. There is a shouted command and a billowing cloud of smoke appears in front of them, they have unleashed a volley of musket fire at you. Desperately you throw yourself to the ground. Make an Evasion Roll.

You instruct CAIN to link up with the Eiger Service computer to check for any news. CAIN chimes: 'Incoming holo-message Falcon.'

Agent Bloodhound's face seems to come alive inside Falcon's Wing. He nods a greeting at you: 'On line, Falcon. How's the mission going? A tough one this, eh? Anyway, I have an important message for you. We've picked up some strange disturbances only a quarter of an hour ago in the timelines of the timehole on Dustbowl. I've just returned from a routine check there. Something appeared and then left the Dustbowl timehole within a space of about one hour. It caused a disturbance in the Winds of Time that is completely unlike anything previously recorded and was of great power. Monitoring is sure it was not a Variac Drive emission. It could be Baal. Something else has come up too, Falcon. A new timehole has appeared in the Planet Cave, in 432 AD. As routine, an agent was sent to establish a monitoring device. They sent the new agent, Kingfisher, on this mission, thinking it was a good training run. Unfortunately, he never came back. The young novice has been killed. Also, the present-day Queen of Cave, has asked the TIME executive for help. It seems there have been some disturbances in their past. Someone or something is up to no good there Falcon. Anyway, that's all. I'll hope to see you soon in the Rec Centre. Good luck.'

'Thanks Blood,' you reply. You must continue your quest.
Where will you go to next:

The colony planet, Dustbowl, in the year 2764 AD (even if you have been there once already)?
The new timehole on Cave, in 432 AD?

You set co-ordinates for Dustbowl 2764 AD and instruct CAIN to use the Variac Drive. Moments later your mind is searching through null-space for the psychic pattern that marks the timehole and soon you are guiding the navigational computers to Dustbowl. You rematerialise from the grey nothingness of null-space to a grey expanse of crates, machine tools and rows of indefinable apparatus. The cameras show a large warehouse, dark and gloomy, apparently empty. CAIN tells you that Falcon's Wing is disguised as a set of crates marked 'Eiger Corporation' and proceeds to give you an historical up-date: 'Dustbowl is a completely barren planet, devoid of life except for one spot in the planet's surface, an enormous crater, presumably caused by a huge asteroid. The crater, some 2000 miles in diameter, is able to retain an atmosphere and is filled with extremely fine dust, forming the Sea of Dust. Within the sea, various organic life forms are found. Initially Dustbowl was, not unnaturally, passed over for colonisation. However, in 2631 AD, there was a short internecine struggle within the colony of Ascension. A group of religious fanatics had attempted to overthrow the government. This group was exiled from Ascension, along with many others Ascension saw as undesirable. The exiles came to Dustbowl, the only place they could find, and have been here ever since. The original religion has all but died out by this time, apparently it involved some form of sacrifice. Dustbowl is now a thriving colony. Luckily the exiles found a native organism, the Dustwhale, a great source of income. Not only is its flesh consumed as a great delicacy on other worlds (especially Kelados), it was found that its oil was of vital importance in the manufacture of Anagathics, the life prolonging drugs so common in the Federation of 3033 AD, Falcon. The colony itself is noted for its repressive social laws and is thought by many to be "boring". We are currently in a warehouse in the only city on Dustbowl, called Refuge. The city is high up on the cliffs that surround the crater and is covered in an Environment Dome. People leave the Dome only to sail the Sea of Dust and hunt the whales.' You will have to go outside to set up and use the detector so you ask CAIN to activate the Molecular Convertor. CAIN instructs the Convertor to manufacture the clothes of a typical Dustbowl sailor, a dustwhaler. You emerge into the deserted warehouse clothed in thick, bulky, brown and white cloth, designed to keep out as much dust as possible. Soon you have the tripod in place. The strange luminescent gem begins to glow and you use your Psychic Awareness to explore its psionic emanations. Apparently, no part of the Rack is to be found within the city, but unfortunately Refuge's Environment Dome is preventing the detector from functioning outside the city. With a sigh of resignation you realise that you will have to go out of the city to make absolutely sure Baal has not been here. For this you will need more equipment, and you turn back to Falcon's Wing. The Mind Scanner goes green and you are drawn up into the cabin. Turn to 54.

You target a rocket on the creature and it surges up out of your back-rack, retros blazing. As the rocket orientates itself, the thing in the powersuit lifts its laser rifle and fires at you. Make an Evasion Roll.

You jump backwards, but a volley of small javelins fly from the wall to your left along the whole length of the slab. One of them slaps into your arm. Lose 5 Endurance points. Plucking the dart from your arm, you press on. Will you:

Step on to the slab directly in front of you, still close to the left wall?

Taking the detector tripod, you leave Falcon's Wing, and set it up behind a white adobe house that is adorned with many bright flowers. As the white gem begins to glow brightly you explore its psionic emanations with your mind. You find it is registering the presence of a segment of the Rack. It is lying in one of the buildings near the Great Pyramid. Putting the tripod back in Falcon's Wing, you head towards the pyramid. As you near it the babble of many voices grows louder. Rounding a large stone building you are presented with an awesome sight. You are at the top of a flight of one of the many stone steps leading down to an enormous plaza, surrounding the Great Pyramid. The plaza is filled with thousands upon thousands, a teeming crowd of Aztecs. Most are dressed simply in feathered shirts or robes, others are dressed richly in brightly patterned robes and headdresses. The stairs that rise up the centre of the bricked pyramid are filled with hundreds of prisoners, almost naked, many covered in white down stuck to their bodies by their own blood. They are formed into a long column marching into the plaza itself. Aztec Eagle Knights, and Jaguar Knights, dressed in the skins of the jaguar from head to foot, are hemming them in. At the top of the pyramid are many black robed priests as well as what must be the Emperor Ahuitzotl, wearing the most incredible finery, with his retinue. The sight of what they are doing fills you with revulsion. Methodically the priests are laying the prisoners on a blood-encrusted stone slab, slashing open their chests with obsidian knives, ripping out their hearts and smearing them over the carved idols of their gods. From what your Translator can pick up, it is a sacrifice to the Sun God, Huitzilopochtli, the Lord of War. Horrified, you make your way through the crowd, towards the building housing the piece of the Rack. It is a low structure, with a large square entrance, hung with bright curtains. Two Jaguar Knights stand guard at either side. Not wishing to waste time in this place of death, you decide to Thinkstrike them in rapid succession. Turn to 311.

14
At the last moment the creature swerves aside as the bolt of superheated plasma crashes into the far wall of the warehouse, leaving a smoking crater. It swoops down at you. Desperately, you hurl yourself towards the crates disguising Falcon's Wing, rolling along the ground. Make an Evasion Roll.

Your target remains unaffected and they press home their charge. They are inexperienced at this type of work, no match for your finely trained skills in unarmed combat. However, there are three of them and, although you demolish them in thirty seconds flat with a series of devastating kicks and punches, one of them manages to gash your thigh badly, lose 6 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you hurry on towards the moored ship. Turn to 416.

16
Looking at the camera screen you can see that you are on the wharf of some kind of port. Crates and miscellaneous equipment are piled everywhere and the air is almost opaque. It seems to be filled with clouds of very fine dust. The 'sea', you notice with surprise, is in fact a vast expanse of a heaving reddish substance, apparently also of very fine dust. The sun is high in the sky, and is very white. The sky is a misty maroon, tinged with blue at its edges. Behind you and stretching away to either side, fading into the distance, vast rocky cliffs tower high up into the sky, further than you can see. Some way to the left you can make out a cluster of buildings. CAIN tells you that Falcon's Wing is disguised as a set of crates marked 'Eiger Corporation' and proceeds to give you an historical up-date: 'Dustbowl is a completely barren planet, devoid of life except for one spot in the planet's surface, an enormous crater, presumably caused by a huge asteroid.

CAIN instructs the Convertor to manufacture the clothes of a typical Dustbowl sailor, a dustwhaler. You step out clothed in thick, bulky, brown and white cloth, designed to keep out as much dust as possible. You also have a filter mask, enabling you to breathe in the dustfilled atmosphere here.

You disappear into the hologram as the bolt of energy explodes behind you, leaving a deep crater in the road. You are drawn up into Falcon's Wing and jump into your crash-couch, setting coordinates for the Eiger Vault as quickly as you can. The cameras show Baal hesitating at your disappearance, but the screens are filled with yellow flame as he blasts Falcon's Wing. The Time Machine shudders as Baal slams into it, howling malevolently, and it crashes onto its side. Your console displays a stream of damage reports, lights flashing and alarms screaming. You shout at CAIN to engage the Variac Drive, hoping it is not damaged, as, to your horror, Baal picks up Falcon's Wing as if it were made of wood and prepares to dash it to the ground. Make a Chance Roll.

You step out into the tavern, Rack detector in hand. Some Burrowers turn to you but then continue their excavation - too stupid to react to your presence. You set up the ancient tripod and it glows brightly, which disturbs the Burrowers. Your Psychic Awareness tells you it has located a section of the Rack. Quickly you replace the tripod in Falcon's Wing and hurry down the tunnel leading out of the cavern in search of the Rack Segment. Turn to 29.

Almost simultaneously, you both drop to your feet in the long grass. 'All right, Falcon?' whispers Lynx. 'Okay/ you reply. 'You?' 'Unhurt,' she answers. Looking up over the edge of the long grass, you see the blue-coats stepping back into the woods. The Union have finally occupied Culp's Hill. Suddenly, a section of the woods on the left side of Culp's Hill winks out, Yelov has escaped in his Time Machine. Lynx drops her head in disappointment. 'I'll have to find him again. Thanks anyway, Falcon, let's head back to our Machines.' Slowly, you crawl through the grass until you are behind the Confederate lines. 'Well, good luck, Falcon, I hope to see you soon. Bet you I get Yelov before you get Baal!' Smiling, you climb Benner's Hill and soon you are approaching the clump of trees disguising Falcon's Wing. Turn to 333.

CAIN chimes: There is an incoming report from the Monitoring System, Falcon. A new timehole has appeared in the Planet Cave, in 432 AD. As routine, an agent was sent to establish a monitoring device. They sent the new agent, Kingfisher, on this mission, thinking it was a good training run. Unfortunately, he never came back. The young novice has been killed. Also, the present-day Queen of Cave has asked the TIME executive for help. It seems there have been some disturbances in their past.' Will you:

You move round behind the cave and climb up the ridge. Soon you are standing above the cave when suddenly your battlesuit takes a bolt of laser fire. Subtract one from your armour points, but you are unhurt. You look up to the opposite ridge as you drop to the ice. Achov, or rather the creature, is on top of the ridge, a laser rifle in his hands. It set a trap for you and you fell for it. The face inside the powersuit is not Achov's, it is something else, something you are glad not to be able to make out. You are taken by surprise and it opens fire again, a lance of ruby light spanning the gap between the ridges in nano-second. Make an Evasion Roll.

You set co-ordinates for South America, Earth, in 1487 AD and soon Falcon's Wing is sailing on the Winds of Time towards its destination. You may lie in your Autodoc during this journey and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance. The cameras show that you have materialised in bright sunshine. You hold your breath in astonishment as the cameras revolve. You are in a great city in the middle of a lake. The shores of the lake are studded with townships, each with a core of brightly painted stone houses, surrounded by smaller white adobe houses. Each township has a tiered, brilliantly painted pyramid rising from it. The city itself is perfectly square, with three causeways leading to the mainland. It seems to have been constructed with great precision. Much of the city is criss-crossed with canals, upon which are moored many canoes. The houses are mostly of adobe, with some of stone, presumably for the rich and powerful, and all are single storey buildings with no windows. You can see the flat roof tops have low tables on them, pottery and the like. But your attention is drawn to the centre of the city. You can see a huge pyramid reaching up over the city. Other large buildings surround it, covered in carved friezes, in a strange, stiff style. The pyramid has a wide flight of steps climbing up its front. You can see figures moving all over it but, strangely, the immediate vicinity seems deserted as do the townships. However, the external microphones are picking up the noise of a huge crowd coming from the main pyramid. Turn to 6.

23
You explain what has happened to CAIN and it replies: 'Obviously Baal has visited Dustbowl at some point in time since his escape and won over a group of the superstitious Refugers to his cause. However it seems no part of the Rack has been left here, Falcon, so I would strongly advise you to continue the search elsewhere.' Where will you continue your search:

Rigel Prime, in 1642 AD, if you have not been there already?
South America, Earth, 1409 AD, the time of the Aztecs, if you have not been there already?
North America, Earth, 1863 AD, the time of the American Civil War, if you have not been there already?

You seize control of his mind and force him to turn and attack the man behind him. This catches him completely by surprise and the man under your control drives his knife into the other's abdomen, who sinks to the ground, retching. The third man stops, astonished.

You tell CAIN where the section of the Rack lies, and ask it how it could be reached. 'The Sea of Dust is very deep, Falcon, even in our own time its depths haven't been fully plumbed. However, Falcon's Wing could withstand the pressure and you would need a modified battlesuit to move about on the seabed. For that you will have to return to the Eiger Vault and ask Section Chief Jobanque to issue you with one,' You set co-ordinates for the Eiger Vault, 3034 AD and instruct CAIN to engage the Variac Drive. Turn to 39.

As you walk onward, in the soft glow of the phosphorescent fungus, the unmistakable sound of battle echoes down the tunnel. Cautiously edging along the side of the corridor you come to a T-junction. Poking your head out you look to the left. A group of yellow and black furred Burrowers are waiting placidly, a mass of mud and rock at their feet. Turning your head to the right, you are greeted by the cause of the sound. The tunnel is filled with two lines of what must be Warriors, some yellow and black, the others with dull red fur, engaged in a vicious death struggle. The Warriors are frightening to look at. They have two arms ending in what can only be described as serrated sword blades, presumably of bone or hardened cartilage. Viciously sharp horns protrude from their domed heads, their elbows and knees. Their feet resemble the claws of a bird, except that they are of sharp cartilage, all talons. Their heads are much the same as the Burrowers, except for the massive fangs. What is most frightening is their speed and ferocity and the feral savagery with which they are ripping each other into shreds. Incredibly swift and powerful, they are creatures bred for one thing only - killing. Behind each rank of Warriors there are two or three Nobles, giving orders. They are human in shape, except for their heads. These are much the same as the Burrowers, except for a membrane covering a circular cavity above the mouth. They communicate by
vibrating this membrane to produce sound. Turn to 44.

A musket ball thuds into your shoulder, the impact stops you dead in your tracks and you are thrown into the long grass. *Lose 74 Endurance points.* If you are still alive Lynx, unhurt, comes to your side, crawling through the long grass. Quickly she applies a field dressing and a local anaesthetic. The Autodoc will deal with the rest, Falcon,' she says. Looking up over the edge of the long grass, you see the blue-coats stepping back into the woods. The Union have finally occupied Culp's Hill. Suddenly, a section of the woods on the left side of Culp's Hill winks out. Yelov has escaped in his Time Machine. Lynx drops her head in disappointment. 'I'll have to find him again. Thanks anyway, Falcon, let's head back to our Machines.' Slowly, you crawl through the grass until you are behind the Confederate lines. 'Well good luck, Falcon, I hope to see you soon. Bet you I get Yelov before you get Baal!' Smiling, you climb Benner's Hill and soon you are approaching the clump of trees disguising Falcon's Wing. Turn to 333.

You try to avoid the attack, but it hits you squarely on the shoulder sending up a shower of sparks. Subtract 3 from your Battlesuit armour points, but it has protected you from any damage this time. Will you:

You can feel the rush of beaten air from the wings of the flybeast as its mandibles clash together inches from you. It pulls up to avoid what it thinks are crates, but what is in fact the hologram disguise. You roll onward and disappear into them and are drawn up into Falcon's Wing. The creature seems to guess what has happened for a second or two later, it crashes into Falcon's Wing, causing it to shudder ominously. However, CAIN assures you that Falcon's Wing is easily able to withstand the batterings of a mere twelve-foot fly. Muttering darkly about personality programmed computers, you settle into your crashcouch. Turn to 23.

33
He seems unaffected and they are almost upon you. You have no time to do anything "but Thinkstrike. Turn to 376.

34
You set the co-ordinates for North America, Earth 1863 AD, and instruct CAIN to engage the Variac Drive. Moments later your mind is searching through null-space for the psychic pattern that marks the North American timehole. You may lie in your Autodoc and restore up to 12 points of lost Endurance during the journey. You rematerialise on a wooded hill, with good all-round visibility, but your vision is partially obscured by clouds of gunsmoke. To the south is a small town wreathed in smoke. Dense forest lies to the east, another wooded hill rising from it. To the west, you can see a column of men, armed with primitive muskets and dressed virtually in rags, mostly a butternut brown in colour. A few, mainly officers, are wearing grey uniforms. They are marching towards you across a road. The air is filled with the sound of volleys of musket-fire, the boom of cannon and the sound of many men at war. Suddenly a column of men dressed in blue uniforms, stream past your hill, near the town, in what can only be described as an orderly rout. It appears you have arrived in the middle of a battle. You ask CAIN for information. This is the field of Gettysburg, a decisive battle in the American Civil War fought on the eastern edge of North America, Falcon. It was fought over three days, and we have arrived in the late afternoon of the first day. The Civil War was between the Union and the Confederacy, over reasons too detailed to go into here, unless you'd like me to?'

'No, no, CAIN, that's all right,' you interrupt hastily.

'Well, the Confederacy, the men in grey, had the better of the first day, but ultimately they were defeated, despite their brilliant commander. General Robert E. Lee. You have materialised on Benner's Hill. The hill to the south is Culp's Hill and beyond that Cemetery Ridge. The town is, of course, Gettysburg. It would be best to disguise you as a Confederate soldier for the moment. However, the jacket will be reversible, so that the outside is grey, the inside blue, if you should need to change sides in a hurry.' Donning the disguise the Molecular Converter has given you (your helmet is now a peaked grey cap), you take the detector tripod and leave Falcon's Wing. Turn to 314.

As you get to your feet, you can see that the Darkhome Noble rebels have made a decision, and a stream of Warriors are charging towards Baal. He towers above them, three times their height, destroying them in droves with blasts of yellow energy and great blows of his boulder-like fists. But the Warriors have no fear of death and they attack heedlessly. They seem to be unable to hurt him seriously, but you have time to act whilst he is distracted. You come to the steel door, but there does not seem to be any way of opening it. Will you;

Try to blow the door open with your blaster?
Try to burn a hole through the rock next to the door with your blaster?
Put some magnesite (if you have arty) at the base of the door and blast it? Maybe the intense heat generated for a few seconds will burn a hole through the door?
Try your microbeam key (if you have one)?

As you gather yourself to leap, the energy bolt explodes at your feet, blasting you into the air and hurling you into a nearby building with bone-crunching impact, and you sink into unconsciousness. You never wake up. You have failed.

You set co-ordinates for Earth in 3033 AD and you are soon surrounded by the grey nothingness of null-space. You may lie in your Autodoc and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance during the journey. You rematerialise in the Eiger Vault and whilst a TIME maintenance team are replenishing Falcon's Wing's supply of polybdenum, you instruct CAIN to link up with the Eiger Service computer to check for any news. CAIN reports that nothing new has occurred during your visit to Gettysburg. You will have to continue your search. Which timehole will you travel to:

Rigel Prime in 1642 AD, if you have not been there already?
South America, Earth, 1409 AD, the time of the Aztecs, if you have not been there already?

If you already have a segment of the Rack, you must decide whether or not to take it with you. Taking the detector tripod, you leave Falcon's Wing, and set it up behind a white adobe house that is adorned with many bright flowers. As the white gem begins to glow brightly you explore its psionic emanations with your mind. You find it is registering the presence of a segment of the Rack. It is lying in one of the buildings near the Great Pyramid. Putting the tripod back in Falcon's Wing, you head towards the pyramid. As you near it, the babble of many voices grows louder. Rounding a large stone building you are presented with an awesome sight. You are at the top of a flight of one of the many stone steps leading down to an enormous plaza, surrounding the Great Pyramid. The plaza is filled with thousands upon thousands, a teeming crowd of Aztecs. Most are dressed simply in feathered shirts or robes, others are dressed richly in brightly patterned robes and head-dresses. The stairs that rise up the centre of the bricked pyramid are filled with hundreds of prisoners, almost naked, many covered in white down, stuck to their bodies by their own blood. They are formed into a long column marching into the plaza itself. Aztec Eagle Knights, and Jaguar Knights, dressed in the skins of the jaguar from head to foot, are hemming them in. At the top of the pyramid are many black robed priests as well as what must be the Emperor Ahuitzotl, wearing the most incredible finery, with his retinue. The sight of what they are doing fills you with revulsion. Methodically the priests are laying the prisoners on a blood-encrusted stone slab, slashing open their chests with obsidian knives, ripping out their hearts and smearing them over the carved idols of their gods. From what your Translator can pick up, it is a sacrifice to the Sun God, Huitzilopochtli, the Lord of War. Then your Psychic Awareness picks up a strange psychic disturbance you have never experienced before, something akin to the psychic patterns of null-space. Turn to 125.

Soon you are back in your bay at the Eiger Vault. You put a call through to Jobanque on the holophone, Priority One. He answers immediately: 'Falcon, what news?' You tell him what has happened and what the situation is on Dustbowl. 'Right, I'll authorise the battlesuit,' he says, 'and I'll talk to you soon.' With that he breaks contact. You wait while your polybdenum supply is replenished. Soon Jobanque holophones through. 'Okay, Falcon, Skirrow and I have come up with something. Falcon's Wing will be painted in company colours and made to look like a scientific research diving bell. You can pretend to be a scientist from Earth, sponsored by a fictitious Earth company, say the Eiger Coporation, sent to Dustbowl to research the breeding habits of the Dustwhale. We'll give you forged credentials and money, of course - in this case Dustbowl placs. The battlesuit has been modified for high pressure. You won't be able to see anything down there, but you'll have your microbeam radar, and we've fitted a high resolution graphic delineator. This will analyse the radar reading and render it as a visual graphic on your battlesuit face plate. It'll be just like seeing normally almost. Anything you see won't actually be there, the graphic delineator will just show you what something the radar has picked up looks like. You'll have to use the radar to determine the position of anything. We'll give you some high-tensile wire to lower Falcon's Wing and the like, to make your scientific expedition look convincing. You'll have to go back to Dustbowl and hire a whaling ship and get it to take you out to where the Rack section lies - this kind of expedition was reasonably common in those times. I know this is breaking the First Law of TIME, but under the circumstances, we have no choice. One final thing - Dustbowl in 2764 had a high level of legislation. They were particularly strict on citizens carrying fire arms, especially energy weapons, so be careful with your blaster. That's all. Good luck, Falcon!' Moments later, the battlesuit is delivered to you, along with a selection of equipment, steel lances, rotary drums, a mini-lab and the battlesuit. Maintenance technicians are working frantically on the hull of Falcon's Wing. Painting it in green and gold and adding bits of impressive, but useless, equipment to its hulk. An hour or so later, everything is ready and you fade into null-space, bound for Dustbowl once more. Turn to 48.

You emerge from Providence Airlock and walk into the city of Refuge. Catching a hovbus you head back to the warehouse. A quarter of an hour later, you step off the hovbus near the warehouse. As your foot hits the ground, four black-robed figures, waiting at the entrance to the warehouse, charge at you without hesitation and in silence, drawing long, wickedly curved daggers. You barely have time to act. Instinctively, you hurl yourself, rolling, at their feet, hoping to trip them and run on, to the safety of Falcon's Wing. Make an Evasion Roll.

You move towards the officer and he puts you in the front line, giving you a musket and staring at you suspiciously. Then a man in a smart grey uniform with yellow piping rides up, accompanied by several aides. He seems to be giving orders to the officer. One of the men says: That's Jubal Early, our divisional commander, I betcha we're going in to the attack.' 

Then a bugle sounds and the officer shouts, 'Over the wall, men, and at 'em!' A loud cheer goes up, accompanied by a strange whooping and soon you are charging over the wall and into the open. 200 yards ahead is a small river, Union troops are pulling back across it. In front of them are a line of logs, carts and the like, behind which a row of Union troops are waiting. The small river disappears in the heavy wood that blankets Culp's Hill. It is quite exhilarating as you sprint onwards, the men all around you cheering wildly. Then there is a loud crackling sound all along the Union line, as they unleash a volley of musket fire. Men to the left and right of you drop like sacks of coal, but you are pushed on from behind. A little later they open fire again. Make a Chance Roll.

That night, you are woken in the low bunk of your cabin by a slight sound. Opening your eyes you look up to see a figure, eyes wild and staring, a long dagger held in both hands over his head, poised to strike at you. This death is for Baal,' he whispers. It seems the priesthood of Baal have followers everywhere, will they never give up? Will you:

As you watch, the red-furred Nobles begin to fire at the yellow Warriors with small laser pistols, cutting them down in great numbers. This amazes you, as this technology should not be available at this time. One of the yellow-furred Nobles trills at the other and your Translator renders it as: The rebels are breaking through, we must fall back and use the Burrowers, our farms must be protected.' The Nobles run past you to the pack of the Burrowers, trilling orders. The Burrowers begin to work at a rapid pace, sealing off the corridor, whilst the Warriors battle on, mindlessly, until the last falls.

The red-furred Nobles confer amongst themselves. It seems they are going back to fetch Burrowers of their own to force the corridor. Then one of them says, 'We will send the Warriors to secure the outer cavern. May the Baal-Mother triumph.' Your eyes widen in surprise - could Baal be here? Then five Warriors begin to move towards you whilst the rest move back down the corridor. The outer cavern must be the one where Falcon's Wing lies. There is no way of avoiding these five Warriors, you will have to fight them. They turn the corner, jogging in unison. Will you:

You are not quite fast enough. You can feel the rush of beaten air from the wings of the fly beast and then a sharp pain as its mandibles clash together, taking a chunk out of your shoulder. Lose 6 Endurance points. If you are still alive, the fly pulls up to avoid what it thinks are crates, but are in fact the hologram disguise. You roll onward and disappear into them and are drawn up into Falcon's Wing. The creature seems to guess what has happened for, a second or two later, it crashes into Falcon's Wing, causing it to shudder ominously. However, CAIN assures you that Falcon's Wing is easily able to withstand the batterings of a mere twelve-foot fly. Muttering darkly about personality programmed computers, you settle into your crash-couch. Turn to 23.

You set the co-ordinates for Rigel Prime, 1642 AD and instruct CAIN to use the Variac Drive. Moments later your mind is searching through null-space for the psychic pattern that marks the timehole and soon you are guiding the navigational computers to Rigel Prime. You rematerialise safely and your cameras reveal a strange wooded glade. The sky is a deep yellow colour. The ground is covered in a close knit layer of spongy turquoise grass. There are trees, odd mounds, some two or three feet high, with thick trunks, sprouting heavy branches laden with fat blue leaves. You are in a depression in the ground. The rim of the glade is covered with trees, so that you cannot see beyond it. You ask CAIN for an historical update. It chimes: 'Lord Silvermane of TIME is of course a Rigellian. But Rigel Prime in 1642 AD was a much less civilised place. Technology is low. Politically, the planet is divided into groups of family clans, corresponding to the nations of ancient Earth. The hierarchy of society is almost completely based on a warrior code of physical prowess. Those victorious in combat, male or female, will be the rulers. It is a very violent society. However, sensibly, mass wars are never fought. The concept of the honourable duel is very important to the 17th century Rigellian. Differences between clans are settled in the arena, usually an expanse of land containing many types of terrain in which specially selected teams duel to the death. The atmosphere of Rigel Prime is sufficiently Earth-like for you to breathe, however its gravity is twice that of Earth. I doubt you will be able to withstand the discomfort for long, Falcon. I have disguised Falcon's Wing as a clump of indigenous vegetation.'

'What about a disguise for me, CAIN?' you ask.

'Well, Falcon, due to the enormous size of the Rigellians you will have to masquerade as a child. As you know, Rigellians are blue in colour, but you could pass yourself as an apprentice apothecary or Rigellian medic. They were known to wear masks and to be fully clothed.' Soon you are dressed in bright scarlet and green with a full face helmet upon your head, concealing your features. A long dagger is strapped to your right thigh and a broad, slashing blade hangs at your belt. It seems even Rigellian medics expect to fight. Taking up the tripod detector, you leave Falcon's Wing. Turn to 67.

You spend the time journeying through null-space by taking a much needed rest. When you arrive, you instruct CAIN to create a hologram - this time Falcon's Wing is simply a diving bell amidst the rest of the harbourside equipment. You leave your Time Machine in search of a ship for hire dressed in Earth clothes of the period - tight high-waisted trousers and loose sleeveless jacket, with many pockets and a communications/ recording helmet, in the fictitious green and gold colours of the 'Eiger Corporation', a Dustbowl filter mask at your mouth and nose. You head for the cluster of buildings to your left. As you approach, you can see a harbour registry office and a Recreation Centre. Moored at the quayside is a whaling ship, all silvered steel from bow to stern. Dustwhalers never paint their ships as the paint is eaten away by the abrasive dust. The ship is long and sleek with three masts, its super resistant sails furled, looking like a 19th Century Earth schooner. A name is etched into its side, 'The Winged Demon', and it flies a black flag, fluttering in the dust-laden wind. Will you:

Falcon's Wing is hurled through the air but winks out inches from the ground. Safe in the grey nothingness of null-space, you heave a sigh of relief, calming your shattered nerves. Soon you are floating on the Winds of Time headed for the Eiger Vault. You ask CAIN what has happened in the timelines, knowing that the first law of TIME has been broken on Tenochtitlan to an unprecedented degree. It replies that the society was almost completely wiped out by the Spaniards in a few more decades, thus cancelling any serious time damage. You may lie in your Autodoc and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance on this journey. Have you been given any information about the Planet Cave? If you have, turn to 86.

The disciple of Baalmakes no move, obviously he doesn't know you have recognised him. Some hours later Falcon's Wing is stowed in the hold and the ship sets sail, scudding across the dust. The second day out, you are gazing out across the heaving red sea when you look behind you to see a ring of twenty or more sailors hemming you in, their faces staring mercilessly. The captain steps forward and says: 'You chose the wrong ship, Offworlder. We are all of the old religion, our Lord is he who you would wish to imprison, Baal, Lord of the Flies. He sent word to us of your coming and now we will exact retribution.' He signals to his men and soon you are overpowered. There is nothing you can do against so many. You are tied up to a block of wood and your heart is cut out and offered up to Baal as a sacrifice. You have failed.

You tell CAIN you must go outside the Dome and it replies that there are large air-locks leading to lifts that go down the cliffface, over a mile, to the whaling port below on the Sea of Dust. Tourists and ordinary citizens often go to view the Sea of Dust. 'However, you will need a pass and some local money, Falcon, I will run these up for you in the Convertor. You will need to hire a filter mask, essential for respiration in the dust-laden atmosphere of Dustbowl.' As the Convertor goes to work the cameras reveal a figure in the entry bay of the warehouse. He is dressed in long black robes over brown leggings, and is looking furtively about, as if searching for something. He holds some kind of instrument in his hand which he examines carefully. Then he begins to move directly towards Falcon's Wing. CAIN chimes: 'My instruments tell me that Falcon's Wing is the subject of a Time Monitor. Somebody has learnt that you are here. That kind of technology was not available at this time, Falcon.' As you watch, the man stops before Falcon's Wing and looks up, as if he was looking straight at you, and he turns to run out of the warehouse. Will you:

In front of them are a line of logs, carts and the like, behind which a row of Union troops are waiting. The small river disappears in the heavy wood that blankets Culp's Hill.

But there is a triumphant howl behind you and, turning your head, you can see that Baal has completely destroyed the Warriors. He turns his attentions to you.

Agent Bloodhound's face seems to come alive inside Falcon's Wing. He nods a greeting at you. 'On line, Falcon. How's the mission going? A tough one this, eh? Anyway, I have an important mesage for you. We've picked up some strange disturbances in the timelines of the timehole on Dustbowl. I've just returned from a routine check there. Something appeared and then left the Dustbowl timehole within a space of about one hour. It caused a disturbance in the Winds of Time that is completely unlike anything previously recorded and was of great power. Monitoring is sure it was not a Variac Drive emission. It could be Baal. That's all for now, Falcon. Good luck, I hope to see you soon in the Rec Centre.'

You walk up the gang plank and onto the main deck of the 'Winged Demon'. A sailor is polishing a huge gun on a swivel mount. It is a rocket powered harpoon gun. His filter mask is painted to resemble an insect's head, and he stares at you dully. You ask for the captain. He stands motionless for a moment and then points down some stairs to a cabin door at the stern of the ship. You go down the steps and knock on the door. 'Enter,'says a gruff voice, and you open the door. It leads into a small cabin lined with charts of the Sea of Dust, with a bunk and a desk. Behind it sits a bearded man in black robes, wearing a yellow headband, presumably denoting his rank, and still wearing a black filter mask. Next to him stands a grizzled old sailor in traditional heavy whaling clothes, also bearded, a long whaler's knife at his side. 'Yes?' says the man behind the desk, eyeing you up and down quizzically. You introduce yourself as Professor Falcon, a scientist sent here by the Eiger Corporation on Earth. You ask if you can hire him and his ship and tell him of your planned expedition. He nods, interested, but when you tell him the co-ordinates you wish to go to he starts and stares at you. Then he says abruptly, 'What do you want to go there for?' his voice muffled by his mask. You tell him about your research into whales and that the area is a prime whale breeding ground. He looks at you and then says, 'Ah, I see,' and nods. 'It'll cost you ten thousand placs, all in. I'm Captain Nathan. Welcome aboard.' There is a knock on the door and a sailor enters.

As you leave the artificial gravity of Falcon's Wing you are instantly struck by the heavy weight of twice the gravity you are used to. It is as if your limbs were made of lead and your breathing is heavy and laboured as you stagger into the cover of some nearby trees, half way up the side of the glade. As if in slow motion you set up the detector tripod. The dull whitish gem begins to radiate a translucent light and you use your Psychic Awareness to explore the psionic emanations of the detector. Within moments you realise that there are no traces of the Rack here on Rigel. As you are packing the detector up, a sound alerts you. Turning, you see a large humanoid figure, seven or eight feet tall, entering the glade. The figure is a Rigellian, obviously dressed for war. He looks much like Lord Silvermane save that his long, shoulder-length hair is jet black. He has blue skin, covered in strange designs painted on in yellow and white. His body is heavily muscled, the legs and arms are like tree trunks, the torso a barrel. In one three-fingered hand he holds an enormous club, a long spiked bar ending in a cluster of sharpened blades. His other arm is armoured from shoulder to hand with spiked steel, ending in a vicious dagger-like blade coming from the top of the wrist. From a wide belt hang several wickedly pointed throwing weapons. The eyes, all white, glare balefully around the glade. You sink slowly into the cover of the trees, hoping not to be spotted. Unfortunately, the Rigellian is now between you and Falcon's Wing. Then there is a sound to your left and another enormous figure, less stocky than the other, but with a hint of tigerish grace, enters the glade. His hair is bluey-green, in one hand he holds what would be to a human a halberd, which serves as a one bladed axe to the Rigellian. In his other hand is one long blade, a hand grip in its middle. His abdomen is covered in linked plates of mail with a spike at the front. Turn to 78.

Quickly, you leave the warehouse, detector tripod in hand, Blaster hidden in the folds of your clothes. You are on a paved street, lined with dark and brooding buildings, all industrial in some way. It is night on Dustbowl. Looking through the transparent Dome of Refuge you see the night sky, scattered with unfamiliar constellations and strange stars. The street seems deserted except for some large automated hovcars that stop at certain points, marked with posts fortunately labelled in Fedspeak. You examine the nearest post. It says 'Refuge Transport Hovbus'. A few moments later a large hovcar hums to a stop beside you and its doors slide open. The computer driver grates, in slightly archaic Fedspeak: 'What is your destination?' You reply that you would like to be taken to see the whaling port and it says 'Providence Airlock, Sir. That will be 130 credits. Please insert your card.'Hoping that CAIN has done its work properly, you pass your credit card through the data processor and sit in the hovbus. The only other passengers are three drunken whalers and a.few other Dustbowlers, dressed in robes of varying dark shades. Soon you are at the Providence Airlock where you hire a filter mask to cover your nose and mouth before stepping into the airlock that leads to the lift, after paying a small toll. Turn to 90.

69
You walk to the door of the Recreation building and it slides open. Stepping in you find yourself in a small airlock, presumably to minimise the amount of dust getting into the main building. You enter a large room with a bar at one end. The air is free of dust and you remove your filter mask. There are a few people, sailors mostly, eating and drinking in groups at various tables. They look up as you enter and you can hear one or two muttering 'Offworlders'. You walk to the bar intent on asking the barman's advice on finding a whaling ship, when your attention is drawn to a small man, obviously drunk, telling a story to a group of attentive listeners. 'Yup, I served on the Winged Demon on its last voyage and ...'

'What did you want to take up with the likes of them for?' interrupts one of the men at his table.

'I needed a few placs, right. Be quiet and listen up. They needed a few extra whalers for this trip, so me and a few others signed up We sailed out for a day or two but, get this, although several whales were sighted, we didn't do no whaling at all! Then one night, I was woke by a noise on deck. I went up and guess what I saw... ? Well, most of the regular crew was dressed in black robes and they were chanting some weird song. And then, strike me dead if I'm lying, a huge figure, more'n twenty foot tall, bursts up outta the sea. In the ship's lights 1 could see he was as red as dust and his eyes were yellow and unnatural looking.' Some of the men scoff at this, but the small man goes on: 'It's true, honest. He flies, yes flies, up above the ship and there was this awful smile on his face, dust etch my bones, I'll never forget that smile as long as I live, pure evil it was. Well, at this I get off that deck as quick as I can and into my bunk. And that's not the end of it. The next day I could swear there were less of them onboard as when we started out. Anyway, we did do some whaling on the way back, but I can tell you, I'm never working on the Winged Demon no more!'

There is silence around the table for a moment but one of the men says, 'You've been drinking too much as usual,' and they break into uproarious laughter. Turning away, you ask the barman about whaling ships for hire.

'Well, most any whaler is up for hire,' he replies, 'but you gotta be careful. I mean, I wouldn't hire out the Winged Demon, even if it was for nothing. Tell you what though, the Dustskate should be here in a day or two and Captain Cresap Ord's a good man. That's your best bet if you're not in a hurry.' Thanking him, you leave the Recreation Centre. Will you:

Go back to Falcon's Wing and wait for the Dustskate to arrive if you think you can afford the time?
Board the Winged Demon and try to arrange an expedition as soon as possible?

Your eyes widen in surprise, but you try not to give anything away. You recognise the sailor as one of the fanatical disciples of Baal who tried to kill you once before. He nods at Captain Nathan and then stares at you, expressionlessly. The Captain says, Take these two men with you and show them the location of your equipment and well get it loaded aboard. The payment will be five thousand placs now and five thousand when we get back to port. Is that agreeable to you?' Will you:

Say yes and lead the two sailors to Falcon's Wing - you may be able to lose them or you may wish to carry on with the expedition regardless?
Turn down the Captain's offer, saying you must first see if you can get a cheaper price elsewhere?
Turn to 81

You catch the creature in the chest, smearing the powersuit and its contents across the ridge, where it freezes instantly, completely inert. All that is left is a broad red stain, frozen solid. Exhausted, you pick yourself up and use your jets to fly back to Falcon's Wing. Turn to 100.

You drop to the floor but a single barbed two-foot javelin explodes from the wall, six inches from the floor and embeds itself into your thigh. Lose 7 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you slowly draw it out, gasping in pain. Will you:

You open fire with your blaster. At such close range you cannot miss and you manage to fry two of them before another darts forward and slashes at your chest with the speed of a striking snake. You are hurled backward, lose 6 Endurance points. If you are still alive, your suit begins to repair itself and you have just enough time to spray a continuous stream of plasma across the width of the tunnel, leaving it dotted with the smoking carcasses of the Warriors. Shaken by their fearless attack, you press on. Turn to 99.

Soon you are safe in your bay at the Eiger Vault. You call in a maintenance team to make the necessary repairs to Falcon's Wing whilst you reflect on what could have happened had you been wearing your battlesuit in the fight against Baal. Have you spoken with Agent Bloodhound during this mission? If you have, turn to 20. If you have one piece of the Rack, turn to 9.

77
You hit the ground, trying to hug it as if it were a blanket against the cold. You can hear the whine of musket balls parting the air near your head, but you are unhurt. Will you:

At the sight of each other, they both stiffen. The taller one moves closer until they are a few metres apart, both still awkwardly close to Falcon's Wing. With an earsplitting bellow and remarkable speed for his size, the shorter Rigellian brings his club across and up at the head of his opponent, who whirls away. In astonishment you watch as they fight, a continuous whirl of glittering steel, feints, lunges, and dodges forming an incredible display of martial skill, almost beautiful to watch if it were not so deadly. Will you:

Stay where you are and await the outcome of the battle?
Try to creep around the edge of the glade and get to Falcon's Wing from the rear?

Captain Nathan suggests you go with the two sailors and load your equipment onto the Winged Demon. Some hours later, Falcon's Wing is stowed in the hold and the ship sets sail, scudding across the dust. The second day out, you are gazing out across the heaving red sea when you look behind you to see a ring of twenty or more sailors hemming you in, their faces staring mercilessly. The captain steps forward and says, 'You chose the wrong ship, Offworlder. We are all of the old religion, our Lord is he who you would wish to imprison, Baal, Lord of the Flies. He sent word to us of your coming and now we will exact retribution.' He signals to his men and soon you are overpowered. There is nothing you can do against so many. You are tied to a block of wood and your heart is cut out and offered up to Baal as a sacrifice. You have failed.

80
Quickly, you leave the warehouse, your blaster hidden in the folds of your clothing. You are on a paved street, lined with dark and brooding buildings, all industrial in some way. It is night on Dustbowl. Looking through the transparent Dome of Refuge you see the night sky, scattered with unfamiliar constellations and strange stars. The street seems deserted except for some large automated hovcars that stop at certain points in the streets, marked with posts fortunately labelled in Fedspeak. The black robed figure is disappearing around a corner at the end of the street. Using your Psychic Awareness to mark his mental pattern, you are able to follow him without having to keep him in sight. You come to a more active area of Refuge. The buildings are still dark and gloomy - it seems all of Refuge has been built in this dark stone. There are seamy shops and drinking houses and the street is lit by a central strip light, running the length of the street. The people seem to be ignoring each other, hurrying along with their eyes fixed on the road ahead of them. You duck down a thin alley until you come to a large door through which your target has just gone. Quietly, you try to push the door open. Suddenly, a panel in the door clicks open and a pair of coal-black eyes glare out at you, looking you up and down. 'Who are you and what do you want?' a voice demands tensely. You can either try to gain entrance and find out who has been monitoring you or you can leave Dustbowl to continue your search elsewhere. Will you:

Thinkstrike the man at the door?
Use your Power of Will on him?
Say 'Sorry, wrong address' and go back to Falcon's Wing?

You agree to the Captain's terms and leave with the two sailors. You lead them along the quayside for a little way. They are quiet and taciturn, it seems they are not interested in conversation. Will you:

A hushed silence falls, as Baal hangs there. Then, with a smile of pure evil, Baal gestures at the priests, the passage of his hand leaving a fading trail of crackling yellow energy. They leap up and frantically continue the sacrifice, offering the hearts up to what they believe to be their god. With a thrill of horror, you realise Baal is feeding off the life forces of the victims, using some kind of psychic vampirism. Even as you watch, he seems to grow stronger, raw energy flickering about him in everincreasing intensity. He throws back his head and laughs, a terrible booming sound that echoes around the plaza. If you are carrying a piece of the Rack, turn to 93. If you are not, turn to 111.

Your assailant sees what you are doing and brings his knife down onto your arm. You grunt in pain, pulling your arm back reflexively. *Lose 8 Endurance points.* If you are still alive, will you:

85
You concentrate hard, but it is surprisingly easy to take control of their tiny minds, they are bred for a lifetime of obedience. You force them to attack their fellows and a vicious battle ensues. In a few bloody seconds four of them are dead. The survivor's leg has been virtually filleted, but it limps towards you. Grimly you blast it back out of the tunnel with a bolt from your blaster and press on. Turn to 99.

86
Soon you are safe in your bay at the Eiger Vault, You call in a maintenance team to make the necessary repairs to Falcon's Wing whilst you reflect on what could have happened had you been wearing your battlesuit in the fight against Baal. You have two parts of the Rack now, you must search for the third. Your only clue is the timeline disturbances and the death of Kingfisher on the timehole on Cave. After the Maintenance Techs have completed their work, you set co-ordinates for Cave, in the year 432 AD. Turn to 205.

87
The battle continues for a few minutes more. The stocky Rigellian parries an axe cut with his armoured hand and then whips his spiked hand across the other's chest, gashing him. Encouraged, he redoubles his attack but the other twists aside and, his arm a blur, seems to pass the twin-bladed sword across the stocky. Rigellian's thigh, opening up a deep wound. He follows up with a mighty axe blow, and the stocky Rigellian is hurled backwards. Suddenly he disappears into a tree. To your horror you realise he has fallen into the hologram disguising Falcon's Wing! The taller Rigellian stands stock still in utter amazement. You must act quickly. Your Time Machine could be damaged and you must also minimise any effects on Rigellian history its sighting may have. Will you:

Thinkstrike the last Rigellian?
Attack the Rigellian from behind, perhaps you can knock him out without being seen?
Creep around the edge of the glade and enter Falcon's Wing from the rear?

Cross the magnesite off your Agent Profile. You pack it around the door, stand well back and fire a blast of plasma that ignites the bluish rock. There is a bright flare of blue light that fills the cavern with the light of day for a few seconds. After the reaction is over you examine the door, but to your dismay it is left without a scratch, and is not even warm. You will have to try something else. Return to 35 and choose again.

89
A few seconds pass and then there is a ragged cheering, accompanied by a strange whooping from behind you. Popping your head up over the long grass you can see a horde of Confederate Infantry in a full blooded charge at the Union lines. They will pass over you in a few moments. You lie still, pretending to be dead. You can hear the repeated volleys of musketfire from the Union lines and the shrieks of the wounded and dying as the Confederates press home their attack. After they have gone, you risk a look. A brief hand-to-hand struggle ensues and then the blue coats fall back, the Confederates too exhausted to pursue for now. Suddenly, a movement catches your eye and a section of wood just disappears. Your holodetector no longer registers another Time Machine. It looks like Yelov has escaped. You make your way to Benner's Hill where you are pleased to see Lynx waiting for you. 'I stopped his attempt on Ewell, but I couldn't prevent him reaching his Time Machine,' she says despondently. 'I was hoping you'd be there.' You tell Lynx what happened. 'Lucky to be alive, as usual, eh, Falcon? Anyway, I must try to find him again. Thanks and good luck with the Baal mission.' Turn to 333.

90
The lift functions as an Environment Dome, but is completely transparent. You can see out over the Sea of Dust. The sun, bright and very white, is rising over the edge of the cliffs, many miles distant, illuminating the Sea of Dust with silver light. Visibility is not good, the air is filled with fine dust which glitters redly in the sun, but you can still make out the vast expanse of heaving dust, a deep rusty red, almost like a lake of blood, punctuated with small specks of gleaming silver - whaling ships. The lift, actually as large as the warehouse you arrived in, hurtles down at an incredible pace and soon you are on the wharf of the port, breathing through your mask. Several massive whaling ships, of steel from bow to stern, and powered with sails, are berthed. Some are unloading massive crates of whalemeat and oil, others are taking in supplies before going out again. Darting behind a large crate you set up the tripod and begin searching for any signs of the Rack. You find nothing, and, after cursing your wasted journey, head back to the lift. Turn to 40.

At this, Captain Nathan stares at you thoughtfully for a moment. Suddenly he leaps up and points at you, shouting, 'Quickly men, kill him in the name of Baal, he is the Time Traveller, Baal has delivered him to us!' You act instantly, driving your fist into the throat of the nearest sailor. He sinks to his knees, gurgling in agony, temporarily disabled. The other vaults the desk, his dagger gleaming wickedly. Meanwhile Captain Nathan picks up a microphone and alerts his crew to your presence, it seems the whole ship belongs to the priests of Baal! Will you:

Run for the stairs?

The white triangle is heating up. Examining it, you can see it pulsing with white light. Somehow, it knows Baal is here or else it is registering the presence of another segment of the Rack nearby. Turn to 111.

94
An hour passes as you labour on, and the storm lessens a little. Then you come to the top of a gnarled ice ridge, looking down into a valley, where a large grey dome rests. Black smoke seeping out from an exhaust vent is whipped away in the wind. This must be the mining station, and using the tripod again, you are able to tell that the item you seek lies far below it. Then you notice a figure in an industrial powersuit coming around the back of the Dome, making towards the circular air-lock door at its base. The figure sees you and stops in its tracks. The body is in a posture of surprise. Your battlesuit picks up a radio signal from the figure. 'I mean, wow, man, like really ultra! Who are you? I mean, I thought this filthy ice-cube was uninhabited,'and he breaks into laughter. You send a message back, saying you are a Scout whose Explorer Class starship's drive failed.

'Am I glad to see you!' you say. 'I thought I'd never find the mining station.'

'What a story, man. Hey, that's really ultra! You'd better come down, I'll take you to the manager. Ultra warm in the Dome.' You'll have to enter the Dome anyway so you go down and join the man. Minutes later, you are through the Dome's air-lock. The man is stripping off his powersuit, so you do the same, stepping out in your environment suit and hanging your battlesuit next to a row of the powersuits. They are virtually the same as yours save without weaponry, armour, microbeam radar, jetpack and the like. He is a tall, thin man, unshaven and unwashed, characterised by quick nervous movements of his hands. As he leads you down a functional grey corridor, all steel, lined with pipes and illuminated by strip-lights, he says, 'I am Sil McReady, the Engineer, pleased to meet you.' You introduce yourself as Lieutenant Falcon of the Scouts. 'Here's the Rec Room, not what you'd call really ultra but it's better'n stinking ice!' and he opens a door in the right hand wall. Turn to 359.

95
In a flash you have your blaster in your hand. Squeezing the trigger you bathe your assailant in a stream of hot plasma. His dagger stops inches from your side and he is blown back against the wall with a loud crash, sinking to the floor, a charred mess. The other two, screaming loudly, hurl themselves at you. You blast one, burning his leg and are struggling with the other when Cresap Ord bursts in with several men. Your attackers are pulled off. After questioning you, the captain orders them locked in the brig. He asks why you think they attacked you, but you pretend ignorance. He examines you suspiciously for a few seconds and then says, 'Anyway, carrying an energy weapon is illegal. Normally, I'm supposed to arrest you now and return to port, but I need the placs you'll pay me. However, I'll have to take the weapon and hand you over to the authorities when we return. It shouldn't be too bad, you are an Offworlder and you were acting in self-defence.' He holds out his hand and you give him your blaster, realising it would be more trouble than it's worth to refuse it. You have several more in Falcon's Wing anyway. You may note you have a new blaster the next time you are in Falcon's Wing. The captain thanks you and leaves, telling you to lock the door. The rest of the night passes uneventfully. Turn to 106.

96
You point the pencil-like microbeam key at the door and press the button. To your pleasure the door slides silently open, and you step through. Lying on the floor is a translucent white triangle, with three small squares buried at each corner, the Rack section. Grabbing it you turn back to the door. Stepping out into the cavern you see to your consternation that Baal, howling triumphantly, has defeated all of the Caver Warriors and is now turning his attention to you. He points at you and a flare of energy builds up at his fingertips. You are just about to steal yourself to try and avoid the imminent fireball, when the segment of the Rack you have just picked up glows hotly in your hands. Baal snarls angrily as he tries to send lethal energy winging its way towards you across the cavern. He tries again and again, but it seems the piece you have just picked up is preventing him from using his natural energy. He is still deadly, however. Now you will have to try to get to the corridor on the other side of the cavern. As you run out across the rocky floor, he scoops up the grisly remains of a Warrior and readies himself to hurl it at you. You will have to distract Baal in some way. Will you:

Use your Power of Will on Baal?
Fire your blaster at Baal?
Try to Thinkstrike Baal?

You jump into the air as a two-foot barbed javelin explodes from the wall, six inches from the floor. It hurtles away under your feet and thuds into the far wall, thrumming loudly for a moment. You land on the slab safely. Wiping the sweat from your brow you continue on. Will you:

Step onto the slab directly ahead of you, in the last row?
Step onto the slab diagonally to your right, the middle slab on the last row?
Step directly to your right, to the centremost of the nine slabs?

Grunting, you force yourself up the side of the glade as it echoes to the ring of steel on steel and the guttural cries of the combatants. Soon, you are at the edge of the glade. You can see that it is part of a large open area, mostly grass, dotted with areas of hilly ground, marsh and forest, all mostly squat and in shades of blue in sharp contrast with the yellow sky. You can just make out some kind of fence or barrier enclosing a few square miles of terrain. It appears you were unlucky enough to materialise in one of the arenas set aside for ritual combat CAIN spoke of. Soon you have worked yourself around to the back of Falcon's Wing. Breathing heavily after the effort of walking in this gravity, you enter the hologram. Falcon's Wing stands undiscovered. You can hear the combat continuing as you approach your Time Machine. Suddenly, there is a meaty crash, a scream of pain cut short, and the stocky Rigellian careers backwards into Falcon's Wing, which shudders with the impact. The Rigellian slumps to the ground, a yellowish fluid seeping from a great wound in its chest. There is dead silence outside the hologram. The other Rigellian must have been shocked at the sight of his enemy seeming to disappear. There is a loud shout and the other Rigellian leaps in, eyes staring in uncertainty, legs braced for attack as he comes to a halt, obviously expecting a trap. He stares at Falcon's Wing for a moment but then sees you, what he believes to be an apprentice medic. Your Universal Translator renders his guttural speech as close as possible into words you can understand as he bellows at you: Treachery! Dishonour upon the Clan Arocks! So "Strong-in-arm-andbody" had an apothecary hidden nearby to help him in battle! I would not have thought it of him. But now your life is forfeit, as is the claim of the Clan Arocks in this matter.' Slowly he raises the axe, almost as large as you. Will you:

Try to disable the Rigellian using your skill at hand-to-hand combat?
Try to use your blaster on him?
Try to use your Power of Will even though he is an alien?

You continue down the shadowed corridor. After a few minutes it opens out into a large chamber, and to a grisly brutal sight. Large shattered eggs lie everywhere, seeping the glutinous remains of many Cavers, heartlessly killed before hatching. It looks as if an entire batch has been destroyed. It is indeed a bitter internal struggle you think to yourself as you hurry on to a tunnel on the other side of the chamber. This leads to another cavern, obviously a Caver's 'farm'. Several red-furred Workers, ignoring you completely, tend large stone vats filled with decaying organic matter. These Workers are two-armed with large hands. Your stomach turns as you notice the semi-decayed remains of many types of Cavers in the vats. A vast expanse of mushroom-like fungus stretches into the darkness. Workers carrying some of the rotting sludge in stone jars are spreading it over the fungus. The Cavers recycle their dead by feeding them to the fungus, presumably their staple diet. Thankful that you are wearing your environment suit and cannot smell anything, you continue along the tunnel that leads out of the cavern. Turn to 107.

100
Soon you are sitting in the warmth and safety of Falcon's Wing, glad to be alive after your hair-raising experience. CAIN says: 'I have new information in my databanks, Falcon. It seems the mining station on Chill was the subject of some horrible attack by a particularly unpleasant alien life form. Only Braxton Bragg, the manager, survived. There is a story about a scout, Lieutenant Falcon, who later the scout service denied all knowledge of. Apparently he saved Bragg's life at the end, but was killed himself, although they never found his body.' You explain the recent events to CAIN, and it remarks, 'Baal must have visited this place many millenia ago, and planted the Rack section and the egg to guard it.' As you listen to CAIN, your attention is drawn to a bright white light behind you. Turning your head, you gasp in astonishment. The four triangles have linked together to form a four-pointed star and it is pulsing rapidly with light that is travelling round and round it. Suddenly, Falcon's Wing begins to dematerialise as your Variac Drive begins to function.

'CAIN?' you query.

'I am not activating it, Falcon.' Somehow the Rack of Baal is causing your Machine to travel in time. Your mind is soon tuned to the psychic emanations of the Rack and you are able to determine that you are headed for the timehole in the Dirkheim Void. But there is nothing in the Void, you think to yourself. After a while Falcon's Wing materialises in open space. Your mind reels as you look around, for there is nothing except blackness. Then the cameras reveal a large asteroid hanging in the black nothingness of the Void. A steel door, surrounded by dull glowing lights like the door in the cavern on Cave, is set into the side of the asteroid. 'I would say that the Rack has led us to Baal's base. Falcon. You have to take it in there.'Nodding grimly you don your battlesuit and, taking the Rack in an assistor arm, leave Falcon's Wing and jet towards the doorway. If you have a microbeam pencil key, turn to 410. If not, turn to 296.

Suddenly there is a sickening, tearing sound and Tsu Tsang's chest rips apart loudly, blood and slime spraying everywhere. Several tentacles writhe and twist forward, hissing and bubbling horribly. Her body jerks convulsively, the jaws crack open and her tongue, impossibly long, slithers out obscenely, splitting like ripe fruit into two pulpy appendages that form into stings like a scorpion's tail in front of your very eyes. Organic juices spurt and flow in rivulets. Utterly horrified you stand transfixed with shock at what you are seeing, as slime ridden tentacles reach out for you. Make a Power of Will Roll as you try to retain control of your senses.

You edge your way to the left, changing your jacket, and then
rise to your feet. Just then you hear a loud cheering and a
strange whooping and a horde of Confederate soldiers appear
behind you, in a full-blooded charge at the Union lines.
Desperately you run forward. Some of the blue coats are
shouting: 'Come on, you can make it!' Then an officer shouts,
'Down man!', instructing you to drop. There is a crackling sound
along the Union line which is instantly wreathed in smoke, as
they unleash a volley of musket fire. The front line of the
Confederates stops as if it had run into a brick wall, but the
others push on. You are trapped between the volleys of the
Union soldiers and the charging infantry, and are forced to
crawl forwards. However, the line of Confederates pass over
you, and you are bayonetted to death, almost as an afterthought.

104
You roll into the chamber beyond as the spot where you were
standing is bathed with lethal energy. As you come to your feet
you can see a translucent white triangle on the floor, three small
squares embedded in each corner, a section of the Rack. Quickly
you grab it. Turn to 24.

The next morning the captain tells you that you have arrived at
the area you are looking for. Using the detector, you tell the
captain the exact spot where you would like the 'diving bell'
lowered. He shrugs his shoulders saying, 'Whatever you like,
but I would have thought one place is as good as another on this
God-forsaken expanse of dust!' Ignoring the murmured
comments of 'Completely mad, these Offworlders', you get into
Falcon's Wing and the crew hook it up with steel hausers to a
huge drum that will lower the 'diving bell'. Sitting in your crashcouch, you watch through the cameras as you sink into the dust.
Soon the screens are completely black, there is absolutely no
light and sight is totally useless. Falcon's Wing begins to bob
slightly as it goes down. CAIN chimes: 'I think you should know
that some life forms can be dangerous here, Falcon. No real
research has been done, but it is thought that the creatures of
the Sea of Dust use some kind of sonar as their senses.
Apparently they emit a light beam of sound which is bounced off
objects and the sound reflection is interpreted, like you would
interpret light coming into your eyes, Falcon.' With a jarring
shudder you hit the bottom. Carefully donning your battlesuit
and taking the detector tripod, you descend into the Sea of Dust.
You cannot see anything except the battlesuit readout on your
face plate. The pressure is great and is almost at the maximum
your suit can take. You will have to be quick. Using the tripod
you soon have the location of the Rack segment. You engage
your microbeam radar and the Rack piece registers as a small
blip on your face plate display, only a few yards to your left.
Slowly you make your way towards it, the servos of your suit
whining under the strain of moving through so much dust.
Turn to 174.
107
Once again, the sound of battle comes to you from up ahead, but
on a much larger scale this time. The tunnel opens out into
another large chamber. Pausing in the shadows you survey the
scene. To your right, two long lines of yellow- and red-furred
Warriors are engaged in a devastating struggle to the death.
You have appeared behind the red-furred 'rebels', this time
commanded by three Nobles. It is apparent that the rebels will
triumph again as the red-furred Nobles are equipped with laser
pistols and are using them to deadly effect. A reserve of twenty

Warriors are waiting behind the three Nobles. Beyond the
royalist lines you can see yellow-furred Burrowers widening a
tunnel through which more Warriors, these with yellow and red
fur, are coming. The loyalists must have launched an attack
through a secret tunnelled corridor, but the assault seems
doomed to failure, the lasers are taking an awful toll; as fast as
the Warriors take up position in the line they are cut down.
Looking left away from the carnage, you notice a tunnel leading
away, into rebel territory. Will you:
Try to help the loyalists?
Go down the tunnel to your left?

You jump up, but an obsidian-tipped spear catapults from the
ceiling directly above your head. You manage to twist your head
aside but the spear enters your body just above the collarbone
ripping through the length of your body and killing you
instantly.

109
You decide to Thinkstrike the stocky Rigellian as he is nearest to
the clump of trees that disguise Falcon's Wing. You hurl a blast
of mental energy at him. There is a grunt of pain and he throws
his head back and staggers like a wounded elephant. The other
Rigellian does not hesitate; he twists aside and, his arm a blur,
seems to pass the twin-bladed sword across the stocky
Rigellian's thigh, opening up a deep wound. He follows up with a
mighty axe blow, and the stocky Rigellian is hurled backwards.
Suddenly he disappears into a tree. To your horror you realise
he has fallen into the hologram disguising Falcon's Wing! The
taller Rigellian stands stock still in utter amazement. You must
act quickly. Your Time Machine could be damaged and you must
also minimise any effects on Rigellian history its sighting may
have. Will you:

You slam into the legs of two of them, but they are ready for you and fall on top of you, pinning you to the ground for a brief moment which is enough time for their two companions to plunge their blades into your body over and over again. You scream in pain as you try to twist away from their daggers but to no avail. They leave your twitching body to die in the gutter.

113
You roll into the chamber beyond, but not before your back is singed badly by the blast of lethal energy that fills the opening. It burns through to your flesh and you lose 6 Endurance points. If you are still alive, your suit, still functioning well, begins to repair itself. As you come to your feet you can see a translucent white triangle on the floor, three small squares embedded in each corner, a section of the Rack. Quickly you grab it. Turn to 124.

You draw your blaster and fire at the disciple of Baal. He is completely surprised and you cannot miss at this range. A river of superheated plasma ploughs into him, burning away his head and shoulders in seconds. The other gives a howl of fear, runs, and is soon lost in the port. You return to Falcon's Wing where you decide to wait until the Winged Demon has left on another whaling expedition, then you can find another ship. You instruct CAIN to disguise Falcon's Wing as a pile of whaling equipment to avoid the prying eyes of anyone in search of the scientist's diving bell.

You force him to turn and attack the two others. They are struggling together when you leap up and shout for help. Turning to the struggling knot you knock one of them out with a quick blow to the temple and then release control of your victim. A few seconds later, you are battling with them when Captain Cresap Ord and several men burst in. Your assailants are overwhelmed and tied up. Captain Cresap Ord asks you why they attacked you, but you pretend complete ignorance. He eyes you suspiciously for a moment and then orders that the three men be locked in the brig. He wishes you goodnight and advises you to lock the door. The rest of the night passes uneventfully. Turn to 106.

A musket ball thuds into your chest near the right shoulder. The impact, like a physical blow, throws you backwards to the ground. Lose 14 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you lie hidden in the long grass gritting your teeth in pain. You can hear the repeated volleys of musketfire from the Union lines and the shrieks of the wounded and dying as the Confederates press home their attack. After they have gone, you risk a look. A brief hand-to-hand struggle ensues and then the blue coats fall back, the Confederates too exhausted to pursue for now. Suddenly, a movement catches your eye and a section of wood just disappears. Your holo-detector no longer registers another Time Machine. It looks like Yelov has escaped. You make your way to Benner's Hill where you are pleased to see Lynx waiting for you. 'I stopped his attempt on Ewell,' she says despondently, 'but I couldn't stop him reaching his Time Machine. I was hoping you'd be there.' You tell Lynx what happened.

You notice that Tsu Tsang is not limping. There seems to be something odd about her, not quite right. Instinctively you draw your blaster, backing up, a sixth sense in your brain sending alarm signals up and down your body. Suddenly there is a sickening, tearing sound and Tsu Tsang's chest rips apart loudly, blood and slime spraying everywhere. Several tentacles writhe out and twist forward, hissing and bubbling horribly. Her body jerks convulsively, the jaws crack open and her tongue, impossibly long, slithers out obscenely, splitting like ripe fruit into two pulpy appendages that form into stings like a scorpion's tail in front of your very eyes. Organic juices spurt and flow in rivulets. Utterly horrified, you stand transfixed with shock at what you are seeing, as slime ridden tentacles reach out for you. *Make a Power of Will Roll* as you try to regain control of your senses.

You slam into the legs of three of them and they fly over you, crashing to the ground. In an instant you are up, but the fourth whips his dagger out, gashing your shoulder as he shouts: 'Die, in the name of Baal!' Controlling your shocked surprise at this, you unleash a Thinkstrike and he staggers back, holding his head. Barging past him you dart into the warehouse, running for the crate marked 'Eiger Corporation'. Then a loud humming fills the air, as if of a hundred bees flying in unison. Turning your head you are greeted by a revolting sight. Flying into the warehouse is what can only be described as a twelve-foot fly, its huge compound eyes glittering malevolently and its black limbs glistening with mucus and lined with cilia. Its mouthparts are working violently, oozing a vile greyish saliva. Incredibly it speaks, the sound disturbingly unnatural, human words not meant for an alien throat. 'You must die, Time Traveller, Baal has spoken,' it bubbles. A wave of disgust comes over you even
though you have seen many strange life forms, as it swoopstoward you, intent on devouring you. Will you:

The air begins to shimmer above the altar, at the top of the
pyramid. A huge twenty-foot figure materialises, hanging in
' space. It is a powerfully muscled man, a deep red in colour, with
slitted, reptillian eyes and taloned fingers. A nimbus of yellow
energy plays about its form. You recognise Baal. The crowd
seems to gasp in astonishment as one, and many fall to their
knees, trembling in fear. The priests and the Emperor fall
abjectly to the floor and a whisper of 'Huitzilopochtli! It's
Huitzilopochtli, the Lord of War,' ripples around the plaza. Turn

Grunting, you force yourself up the side of the glade, and soon
you are at its edge. You can see that it is part of a large open area,
mostly grass, dotted with areas of hilly ground, marsh and
forest, all mostly squat and in shades of blue in sharp contrast
with the maroon sky. You can just make out some kind of fence
or barrier enclosing a few square miles of terrain. It appears you
were unlucky enough to materialise in one of the arenas set
aside for the ritual combat CAIN spoke of. Soon you have
worked yourself around to the back of Falcon's Wing. Breathing
heavily after the effort of walking in this gravity, you enter the
hologram. At the base of Falcon's Wing lies the body of the
defeated Rigellian, a yellowish fluid seeping from a great wound
in its chest. As you approach Falcon's Wing, there is a loud shout
and the other Rigellian leaps in, eyes staring in uncertainty, legs
braced for attack as he comes to a halt, obviously expecting a
trap. He stares at Falcon's Wing for a moment but then sees you,
what he believes to be an apprentice medic. Your Universal
Translator renders his guttural speech as close as possible into
words you can understand as he bellows at you: Treachery!
Dishonour upon the Clan Arocks! So "Strong-in-arm-andbody" had an apothecary hidden nearby to help him in battle? I
would not have thought it of him. But now your life is forfeit, as
is the claim of the Clan Arocks in this matter.' Slowly he raises

You concentrate your thoughts, ready to attack the mind of
Baal. But suddenly, his head snaps round to stare at you and you
feel his mind probing yours - he has sensed your mental power.
Then an incredibly powerful will invades your mind, psychic
power you never imagined possible and against which you have
no hope of resisting. You can do nothing as he forces you to
mount the pyramid. Your heart is cut out and your life force is
consumed by Baal.

132
Mentally, you reach out in an attempt to engage Baal in a battle
of wills but he hardly even pauses as he hurls the corpse of the
Warrior at you with punishing force, brushing aside your
mental assault almost as an afterthought. Caught off guard the
body slams into you, sending you crashing to the ground.
Luckily none of its sharp protuberances have cut you, but the
impact has cracked one of your ribs. Lose 4 Endurance points. If you
are still alive, you rise to your feet. If you have the severed handblade of a Caver Warrior in your possession, turn to 163, if not

Just as you are about to pick up the translucent triangle, you feel an unpleasant pattern of mental thought; some powerful psychic is probing your mind! There is a sudden cry of 'No!', like thunder, coming from above the roof. Then the ceiling begins to shudder and shake, dust and masonry falling from it. Something awesomely powerful is smashing its way in here. Quickly you grab the segment of the Rack.

Concentrating hard, you project the force of your will into the
mind of the fly-being. Its mind is a confusing swirl of alien

thought patterns, so different that it almost unhinges your
mind. However, it seems the creature is under some kind of control, nothing like the mental domination you are familiar with,
rather some kind of binding that has been upon the fly-being for
centuries beyond reckoning, something which you are unable to
affect. Hastily you withdraw your mind as it swoops closer. You
have only a moment. Judging its mind as too alien to be affected
by a Thinkstrike, you go for your blaster. Turn to 160.

Bragg and Achov, a tool box in his hand, are waiting for you at
the corridor junction. The tool box contains the suit computers
and you take your battlesuit control unit. Achov eyes you
silently. Bragg asks you what happened and you explain
everything to him. Achov says he is going to repair the suits and
sets off to the airlock. Bragg nods tiredly, 'Wellit's sealed in the
mine, if it's still alive. All we have to do is wait for the relief ship
now.' Suddenly, an alarm bell rings out, echoing around the
Dome. 'Somebody has left the outer airlock door open!... It
must be Achov! Quick, to the suitroom,' cries Bragg and you run
down the corridor. Reaching it you discover that one powersuit
is missing and the rest have laser beam holes neatly drilled into
their face plates, all useless. However your battlesuit is intact its
face plate is of toughened pastiglas, proof against laser fire. 'It's
not Achov at all!' says Bragg. 'The creature must have got him,
and it's gone outside. There's no telling what damage it can do to
the Dome from outside with a laser weapon! Our only chance is
for you to go outside and kill it, Lieutenant. You should have a
good chance in your scoutsuit.' Knowing that you won't be
returning to the Dome, you tell Bragg to lock himself in a
Titanium Container with enough heating and food to last him
until the relief ship arrives. 'In case I don't make it Brax,' you say.
He nods and says, 'Okay Lieutenant, good luck. Finish that thing
once and for all and let this nightmare end.' Quickly you repair
your battlesuit and put it on, the Rack safe inside it, You say
goodbye to Bragg and he shakes you by the hand. You wait until
he is safely out of the way, then open the air-lock door. A rush of
freezing ammonia-ridden gas swirls in and you quickly seal the
air-lock, closing the outer door. You find yourself on the bleak
surface of Chill once more. It is day time and the weather is good
in so far as there isn't a storm. The visibility is reasonable under
the slate grey sky. You realise you did not sleep at all last night.

Ahead of you is a large log of wood. A blue jacketed man leaps up

knock him senseless with a blow to his neck. Leaping over the
log you find yourself in a hand-to-hand struggle with another
Union soldier. All around, small knots of men are struggling
desperately. Another Union soldier gashes your thigh with his
bayonet, in the melee. Lose 8 Endurance points. If you are still alive,
you drop to one knee and your opponent is about to finish you
off when the Union line breaks and he is forced to flee. A cheer
goes up, but the Confederates are too tired to pursue them.
Tearing a strip of cloth from your shirt, you bind up your
wound. Suddenly, a movement catches your eye and a section of
wood just disappears. Your holo-detector no longer registers
another Time Machine. It looks like Yelov has escaped. You
have to wait a few hours until nightfall before you can get away
from the Confederate soldiers, who make no further attacks
that day. You make your way to Benner's Hill/where you are
pleased to see Lynx is waiting for you. 'Where have you been,
Falcon? I was worried. I stopped Yelov's attempt on Ewell, but I
couldn't prevent him reaching his Time Machine,' she says

You take control of two of the Warriors with ease as their minds

You drive a kick at the huge being's knee cap, but your
movements are painfully slow in this gravity. The twin-bladed
sword whips down, severing your leg at the ankle. Seconds later
the axe is buried in your head, killing you instantly. You have
failed.
151
You step out into a large excavated area, shored up with steel
girders. Tunnels lead off in many directions, huge juggernaut
machines are lying about, currently idle. They are of all shapes
and sizes, huge drills, great caterpillar treads, wheels, jointed
mechanical legs, containers and so on. It is lit by enormous banks
of lamps. Monorails lead off into each tunnel, presumably to the
titanium faces. You board a monorail car and drive it down the
most recently excavated tunnel. It is as silent as a grave, save for
the low thrum of the monorail car's electric motors. The car
hums to a halt in a massive natural cavern of seamed rocks, lit by
the headlamps of two drilling machines. In the centre lies a black
stone altar. On it lies a translucent white triangle dimly pulsing
with light. Slowly you get out of the car, your spine tingling,
suspicious of the quiet emptiness. You edge forward to the altar,
grab the fourth part of the Rack and dart back to the car. You get
it and drive back. You are walking towards the lift when a dull
thud comes to your ears from the darkness of an empty
titanium container. Suddenly, a formless mass of flesh shoots
out of the container, telescoping out towards you, dripping
viscous slime and a fetid stench washes over you. Two stalks
rupture up out of the mass, black glinting eyes forming that fix
their gaze upon you. There is a deafening bubbling hiss, and the
rest of the creature, a large mass of writhing tentacles, bursts
out of the container. It splits open and a column of flesh rears up,
towering above you. At its top rests a hideously twisted human
head, McReady's. Then the column splits open with a vile
smacking sound and a long snake-like neck comes out, a

predatory-looking mouth opening at its end, teeth glistening
wetly. Once again you are transfixed with horror, it is as if the
creature projected fear in some kind of mental attack. Make a

and turn to look at McReady. His eyes roll up into his head.
Suddenly a small, suppurating hole appears in his neck, opening
and closing spasmodically. His skull splits open with a loud wet
crack and something large and bulky shudders forth, forming
into a heavy head, horned and armoured, two small pig-like eyes
at each side> the whole thing spilling rivulets of reddish mucus.
Horrified, Achov and Caleb hesitate. McReady's shoulders split
apart and a bony carapace forms over them. Then a thin jet of
dirty white liquid hisses from the hole in the neck and streams
towards you, Bragg and Achov. Almost as one you duck. Caleb
raises the flamethrower, but McReady's side bursts open and a
length of ridged, slime-ridden bone shoots out with devastating
speed and buries itself in Caleb's chest. He howls in agony as, in
front of your eyes, the bone begins to fuse with Caleb,
retracting slowly, drawing him to the thing. Achov, Bragg and
you open fire in horror, but the creature turns and, putting its
head down, smashes through the door and is away, taking
Caleb's body with it. Achov and Bragg, thunder-struck, turn to
you and apologise for doubting you. Bragg is ashen-faced at the
loss of Caleb. Turn to 166.

Before Baal can throw the body at you, a horde of yellow and
blacked striped Warriors boil into the cavern, between you and
Baal. The loyalists have broken through! The Nobles order
them to attack Baal immediately, his size and bearing draw their
attention away from you and you pass unnoticed. You wait until
the exit tunnel is cleared of the loyalist army and dart down it.

have no way of actually hurting Baal, you should be in Falcon's
Wing by the time he is free to follow. Turn to 237.

You are a little too slow; he cuts your arm with his dagger as you

You catch the arm holding the knife, deliver a quick sharp blow

agony, throw him into the other dustwhaler. They both collapse
into a heap and you sprint away, losing them amongst the
mounds of crates and equipment piled in the wharf. You return
to Falcon's Wing where you decide to wait, until the Winged
Demon has left on another whaling expedition, so you can find
another ship. You instruct CAIN to disguise Falcon's Wing as a
pile of whaling equipment to avoid the prying eyes of anyone in
search of the scientist's diving bell. You may lie in your Autodoc
if you wish, and gain up to 6 points of lost Endurance. Turn to 342.

Bragg speaks, 'Right, it's it or us. We've got to hunt it down and
kill it; if we just wait it'll come for us in our sleep or individually.
There's only three of us now.'
'I agree,' says Achov. 'Let's do it.'
'Okay,' says Bragg. 'Let's go and get the powersuits, Lieutenant

Falcon's battlesuit will be a great asset.' You all leave together,
headed for the air-lock strong room. Unfortunately you
discover all of the powersuits, including your battlesuit, have
had their Central Processing Units ripped out. Achov rifles
through the emergency spares box, 'Damn, the spares are gone
too!' The suits are useless without their computers to guide
them. You won't be able to leave the Dome until you find the
suits' computer cartridges.
Bragg says: 'We'll just have to do without them. We'll flush it
out: Achov, you take the right corridor. Lieutenant, you take the
centre corridor, but don't descend into the mine itself, that
would be too dangerous if it's there. I'll take the left tunnel. Well
each take a short range radio on the same frequency. At the first
sign of trouble, pull back to the junction and radio for help.'
Bragg hands out the radios.
Achov gives you a flamethrower. 'This was Caleb's, he looked
after it well. He was a good man, use it to avenge him.'
Bragg says, 'If we don't find it, it'll be in the mine itself. Then
we'll go down and flush it out.' As you all head down the
corridor you nip into your cabin. Quickly you take out the tripod
and search for the Rack. You discover that it has been taken back
to the Cavern at the end of the mineshaft. You will have to go
down there after all despite Bragg's warning not to. Turn to

Achov's tracks lead up to a nearby ridge. Looking up you can see

The panel slams shut abruptly and you begin to retrace your
steps. You decide that whoever has been tracking you doesn't
have a part of the Rack, that this is your primary mission and
that you had better continue the search elsewhere. You reach

the warehouse where Falcon's Wing rests. Suddenly four black
robed figures, waiting at the entrance to the warehouse, charge
at you without hesitation and in silence, drawing long, wickedly
curved daggers. You have little time to act. Instinctively, you
hurl yourself, rolling, at their feet, hoping to trip them and run
on to the safety of Falcon's Wing. Make an Evasion Roll.

A bolt of superheated plasma burns off the head of your first
target. Before the other two have noticed, you have cut another
down. The remaining Noble turns and fires at you, but you
dodge aside and a thin lance of blue light takes a chunk of rock
out of the wall. Firing on the move, you catch the last Noble full
in the chest, hurling it backwards in a ball of flaming fur. The
rebels will soon be overwhelmed, especially as their Warrior
reserve will be unable to act without orders from the Nobles.
You head towards the tunnel when your foot nudges something
on the floor. It is a Warrior's severed hand, more like a short
sword than anything else. Picking it up, you put it in one of your
suit pouches. Turn to 128.

A bolt of superheated plasma streaks towards Baal, hitting him
squarely in the chest. Coruscating streams of plasma crackle and
spit across his body and he staggers back in the air, howling like
thunder. The crowd back off away from you, and you can hear a
muttering of 'Quetzacoatl'. From what you know of Aztec
mythology, they think you are a god, Quetzacoatl, the enemy of
Huitzilopochtli. This is too much for them and they begin to flee
from the plaza in droves, except for the black-robed priests and
some of the knights, although they make no attempts to prevent
the massed prisoners from running. Then, to your horror, you
see that Baal has survived the blast of plasma and is now
enraged, snarling in fury. He points at you and, to your shocked
amazement, a ball of yellow crackling energy erupts from his
arm and speeds toward you, leaving a glowing vapour trail in the
sky. Desperately, you try to leap aside, amazed at such a display
of inherent power. Make an Evasion Roll.

You are not fast enough and one of the razor sharp horns on the

into your arm. Lose 5 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you
manage to remain on your feet. Just then a troop of red-furred
Warriors charge into the room and straight at Baal, led by two of
the rebel Nobles, still trying to defeat the intruder Baal. They
use their laser pistols on him as the Warriors launch themselves
into the attack. You make it to the exit and sprint down it. Baal's
bellows of rage fill the cavern. You know it will only be a matter
of minutes before Baal has dealt with the Cavers and is hot on
your trail. Turn to 204.

You concentrate hard, trying to bend the huge warrior to your
will. Luckily, his thought patterns are not unlike a human's, and
you catch him completely unawares; to him you are a young
Rigellian medic, posing little threat. He falls under your
domination. You force him to run away from the glade for as
long as you can hold him under your power. He is some miles
away when you release him. Soon you are in the crash-couch of
Falcon's Wing. Your body feels as light as air now that you are in
the artificial gravity of Falcon's Wing. After you have told CAIN
what happened, it chimes: 'You must have landed in a Rigellian
ritual combat arena. My data banks tell me you have changed
Rigellian history slightly, Falcon. The defeated Warrior was of
the Arocks clan. They have now been disgraced since you were
taken to be an Arocks assassin with a new "dishonourable"
weapon. This will have to be logged in TIME records of course.'

You have missed again, but this time the creature's return shot is deadly accurate. A laser beam lances into your battlesuit environment control unit, destroying it. Your suit can no longer maintain any heat and you freeze to death in seconds, helpless against the deadly cold of the planet Chill.

174
When you are close you switch on the computer graphic delineator. This interprets your microbeam radar and renders it visually. It is almost as good as the real thing. The rack segment is a large translucent white triangle, with a hole in its middle. Three tiny objects are embedded in its corners. The whole thing is about the size of your head. Reaching down you feel about, using the touch sensors on the fingertips of your battlesuit. At last you have it. You transfer it to the iron grip of your mechanical assistor arm, and begin to walk back to Falcon's Wing. Suddenly your radar picks up a large blip on the edge of your face plate display. It is moving directly towards you at great speed. You realise it will reach you before you can get to Falcon's Wing. Suddenly, the computer graphic delineator cuts in and a hideous sight fills your face plate and you step back involuntarily, horrified. Some creature, utterly alien, is almost upon you. It has a long head, completely smooth, the skull lengthened to hang over the back. It has no eyes, the mouth like that of an Earth shark. The head lies on a long and sinuous body, like a huge snake, but with tentacles. It is enormous and will reach you in a few seconds, what will you do? Will you:

Launch one of your rockets at it?

Somehow Baal has detected your presence near the Rack
segment. There is a snarl of ferocious rage as he continues his
onslaught on the roof. You dash back towards the portal, as
bricks and mortar cascade into the room. Before you have
reached the doorway, Baal crashes through the roof into the
room and comes to his feet on the floor. His weight sets off a
trap and a volley of javelins fly at him, but they shatter against
his skin as if they were made of sand. He hardly notices them.

his bare hands, laughing maniacally as he does so.

You swerve away and the spiked body sails past you. Baal howls
angrily, scooping up another corpse. Just then a troop of redfurred Warriors charge into the room and straight at Baal, led by
two of the rebel Nobles, still trying to defeat the intruder, Baal.
They use their laser pistols on him as the Warriors launch

Later on that evening, you step out to reconnoitre the quayside.
It is dark now and the port is dimly lit. You are walking along the
wharf when suddenly you are bathed in a mass of bright lights
and a voice booms at you through a megaphone, 'Okay
Offworlder, lay your energy weapon in front of your feet and lie
down. This is the police!' Narrowing your eyes against the glare,
you can see a number of figures in red robes covering you with
Las-rifles. You realise you have no choice, and you have to
surrender. You are booked for murder and for possessing an
energy weapon. There is nothing you can do to escape your fate
as you are never given an opportunity to use your mental
powers. Justice on Dustbowl is harsh, you are sentenced to be
executed in the Las-chair and the sentence is duly carried out.
You have failed.

You take the star-shaped Rack and send it spinning through the

air towards Baal. It leaves a shimmering trail of light behind it as
it arcs down, whining shrilly. Baal's eyes widen in horror and he
screams once more, 'Noooo, not again, please!' Suddenly the
Rack splits into four and each section arrows away to fasten at
Baal's wrists and ankles. He is powerless as the Rack
spreadeagles him, lifting him, cartwheeling around, into the air.
The fly creatures halt in mid-air, hovering, unsure without the
driving will of their master behind them. Each triangle begins to
shimmer and crackle with white light. Then streaks of white
lightning flash from triangle to triangle, enmeshing Baal in
bands of bright energy. Soon he disappears from view,
completely enclosed in a prison of pure elemental energy.
Suddenly the whole thing disappears. The fly creatures flutter
downward, purposeless. At last you have succeeded, you turn

blaster. The plasma splashes off Baal's chest but he barely
notices it, he hardly even pauses as he hurls the corpse of the
Warrior at you with punishing force. Caught off guard the body
slams into you, sending you crashing to the ground. Luckily
none of its sharp protuberances have cut you, but the impact has

There is a howl of ferocious rage and bricks and mortar tumble
into the room. You dash back to the portal but turn to stare at
the sight that greets you. A huge twenty-foot figure has
smashed its way through the roof. It is a powerfully muscled
man, deep red in colour with slitted reptilian eyes and taloned
fingers. A nimbus of yellow energy plays about its form. His
weight sets off a trap and a volley of javelins fly from the wall,
but they shatter against his skin as if they were made of sand.
He hardly notices them. You recognise Baal. You guess he
comes here to feed off the life forces of the sacrificial victims of
the Aztecs, perhaps even masquerading as one of their gods. He
glares at you balefully, his lips drawn back in a snarl of anger.
You cannot help but tremble in fright, faced as you are with the
primordial evil you can see in his eyes. He raises his arms,
sweeping them across the ceiling, destroying more of the roof,
yellow energy crackling and spitting all about him. Do you have

A little later Falcon's Wing is journeying through null-space
towards the planet Cave, thousands of years in the past. During
the journey you may rest in your Autodoc and regain up to 12
points of lost Endurance. Rematerialising, you look at the camera
screens. You are in a large underground cavern of dull grey rock.
In places, the rock is lined with seams of some blue mineral. It is
lit by a dim green glow, emanating from patches of a
phosphorescent mossy fungus, growing around the cavern. At
one end you can see a tunnel leading away, at the other you can
see twenty or so humanoid figures, apparently excavating the
rock. They are short and stocky, with two stumpy legs and four
heavily muscled arms. Two of the arms end in massive claws
that they use to tear at the rock. The other two arms end in four
fingered hands, used to carry the rock away. They have huge
eyes, and large ears like that of a bat's. A single nostril lies above
a small, lipless mouth. Yellow fur with black stripes covers them
from head to foot. They are tearing into the rock with incredible
speed and single-mindedness, but seem to you to be unintelligent. You ask CAIN for information. 'Cave in 3033 AD is
outside of the Federation, but it is a highly advanced society.
Cave is rich in seams of blue magnestite, a natural mineral that
acts like magnesium, burning very brightly. It is used by the
Federation in Starship drives. However, at this time, Cave is at a
stage of development akin to Earth's neolithic age. The planet's
barren surface is too hot to bear life and its atmosphere provides
no protection from the sun's rays. However, beneath the
surface it is a maze of tunnels. Each tunnel complex is ruled by a
Mother. The Mother lays eggs in a batch, that hatch into
specialised individual organisms, broadly divided into Workers,
Warriors and Nobles. Those you can see now are Burrowers,
their only function is to build new tunnels. The Nobles are
intelligent humanoids, the rest are only intelligent enough to
follow orders. There is a strict caste system, like an insect hive,
and each batch of eggs usually differ in fur colouring and tend to
form into what would be called in Earth terms, tribes or clans.
However, each batch owes complete loyalty to the Mother.
Different tunnel complexes often make war on each other. The
Cavers use sound and smell as their primary senses. Although
their eyes are extremely sensitive to light, there simply isn't
enough of it to make full use of this sense. We have arrived in
the Darkhome tunnel complex, where the Cave of 3033 AD has
reported timeline changes. My databanks tell me we have

arrived in the middle of a civil war, the only one ever recorded in
Cave history. The atmosphere has oxygen in it, Falcon, but with
high levels of nitrogen. I'm afraid you will have to use your
environment suit, in any case, Cavers do not wear clothing, so
the Molecular Convertor cannot help you. Try not to get
spotted by any Nobles, Falcon, the response to any nonDarkhome intruder is to attack and destroy at this period in
Caver history.' Turn to 18.

You throw off your terrified inertia, leaping back as a tentacle
snakes out towards you. Then the creature sprouts four
massive trunk-like legs, raising it off the ground. It folds in on
itself, metamorphosing into a single huge mouth on legs, two
lobster-like eyestalks rising above it. Do you have any
magnesite with you ? If you do, turn to 255. If you do not, turn to

You race for the entrance and through the curtained portal, the
two Jaguar Knights backing away from you. You can hear Baal

shouting orders in Aztec to the priests, that your Translator
renders as: 'Kill the heretic!' You find yourself in a maze of
corridors leading through rooms piled with grain, gold,
ornaments and pottery. You are running down a corridor,
towards a richly decorated portal when five or six priests appear
around a corner behind you, wielding obsidian daggers.
Turning, you can see they are without hope and resigned to
death. They think you are a god, but are determined to obey
what they believe is their patron deity, Baal. Will you:
Try to bring them down with a series of
Thinkstrikes?
Cut them down with your blaster?

You invade the mind of one of the Nobles and wrest control of it.
You force it to turn its laser on another Noble, burning a neat
hole through its chest, but the other sees this and, trilling in
surprise, opens fire and kills the one you are controlling. You
experience the horror of a death by proxy as the mind under
your control slips into oblivion. Recovering, it is an easy matter
to pick off the last confused Noble with your blaster. The rebels
will soon be overwhelmed, especially as their Warrior reserves
will be unable to act without orders from the Nobles. You head
towards the tunnel when your foot nudges something on the
floor. It is a Warrior's severed hand, more like a short sword
than anything else. Picking it up, you put it in one of your suit
pouches. Turn to 128.

212
You are halfway to Falcon's Wing when suddenly everything
goes black. The creature has managed to breach the dome and
Bragg has been killed. Braxton Bragg was your grandfather's
friend and it was he who was responsible for your grandfather
meeting your grandmother. They will never meet now, and
your father will never be born. It is as if you had never existed.

213
There is a grunt of pain and the eyes disappear from view for a
moment. Then they are back, wide with fear and astonishment,
and you can hear a muffled curse and: 'Evil sorcery!' It seems
superstition is rife in Refuge in 2764 AD. Then he is gone. You
are about to force the door when suddenly the quiet alley is filled

with the harsh, deafening cry of an electronic alarm. A moment
later and you can hear the sound of many running footsteps.
You have no choice but to flee. You dash down the alleyway as
ten or more black robed figures burst out of the doorway. One
of them points at you and says: 'It is the Time Traveller! Kill him,
in the name of Baal!' Smothering your shocked surprise, you
sprint away. Turn to 245.

You whip out your blaster and fire, catching Caleb in the arm,

The white-hot lightning takes Baal full in the chest and he
staggers back as you keep up a steady stream of plasma, whilst
you charge for the exit. Baal howls in pain, but then your blaster
stops firing, its safety mechanism cutting in as it heats up
dangerously. If you have the severed hand-blade of a Caver
Warrior, turn to 163, if not read on. Baal, essentially unhurt,
hurls the body of the Warrior at you with punishing force. Make

The Rigellian tries to twist aside but a white-hot stream of plasma takes him in the shoulder and he is bowled to the ground. He lies there inert, but still breathing. Soon you are in the crashcouch of Falcon's Wing. Your body feels as light as air now that you are in the artificial gravity of Falcon's Wing. After you have told CAIN what happened, it chimes: 'You must have landed in a Rigellian ritual combat arena. My data banks tell me you have changed Rigellian history slightly, Falcon. The defeated warrior was of the Arocks clan. They have now been disgraced since you were taken to be an Arocks assassin with a new 'dishonourable' weapon. This will have to be logged in TIME records of course.' Resisting the temptation to turn CAIN off, you prepare for another time jump. Where will you search for the Rack now:

You are not fast enough and a bolt of ruby light lances into your

with his pistol, saying, 'Hold it right there!' Quickly you say that
you heard a strange noise in Achov's room not long ago and
thought he was the creature. 'I was watching a horror holo-vid,
you idiot,' Achov quips.
Then McReady points at you slowly and says: 'Lieutenant
Falcon's the creature. I examined the battlesuit, it's not a scout
issue suit, nor did we find any trace of a starship or any drive
emission. We would have picked it up on the sensors, normally.'
Bragg says speculatively: 'Yes Sil, there was no trace of his
starship. The Lieutenant could be the creature.' Caleb backs
away from you, readying his flamethrower. Achov draws a
short snub pistol, an old bullet-throwing weapon. Sil goes on,
'You turn up from nowhere and all this starts to happen.' His
voice is flat and even.
'What were you doing in the lab anyway?' Caleb says loudly. 'I
think we should lock him up until the relief ship gets here,
Braxton.'

'Yes, maybe we should,' says Bragg and Caleb moves towards
you. Will you:

Desperately, you try to ward off the power of Baal's Will but he
is too strong for you, even though he is weakened by the Rack.
You cannot fight any longer and Baal wrests control of your
mind from you. Laughing manically, he forces you to walk up to
him. He tears you limb from limb and feeds off your life force
with some kind of Psychic Vampirism. You have failed.

You are unable to break out of your terror-stricken apathy. A
tentacle snakes out, lashing around your ankle and tightening,

You spin and aim your blaster but before you can fire, Baal
launches a psychic attack. An incredibly powerful will invades
your mind, psychic power you never imagined possible and
against which you have no hope of resisting. You can do nothing
as he forces you to mount the pyramid, where your life force is
consumed by Baal.

You have missed, firing as you are on the run. The stream of

His mind falls under your control. You order him to open the
door and you step inside. In his hand he holds a thin pen black
pencil device. You recognise it as a microbeam key, used to open
doors with locks sensitive to a particular microbeam frequency.
You take it from him. Note it on your Agent Profile. You are in a
small alcove, with a dimly lit corridor leading away from it. You
can hear the sounds of rhythmic chanting coming from down
the corridor. Forcing the door guard to lead you down the
corridor you decide to investigate the chanting. Then, pausing
in the shadows at the end of the corridor, you are greeted by a
strange sight. Forty to fifty people, all in black robes, are
kneeling before some kind of altar upon which is manacled a
young man. Beside him stands a tall hawk-faced figure, also in
black robes. His hands are raised in supplication skyward, the
sleeves of his robe falling to reveal a tattoo on his forearm in the
shape of an insect much like the fly of Earth. He holds an
obsidian dagger in his hand; it seems some strange religious
ceremony is taking place. Then the robed man at the altar,
presumably the high priest, screams, 'Come to us, O Servant of
Baal,' and with one savage motion plunges the obsidian dagger
into the man on the altar and carves out his heart. Then, much
. to your surprise, something begins to materialise in the air
above the altar. Soon it has resolved itself into what can only be
described as a twelve-foot fly, its huge compound eyes glittering
malevolently, its black limbs glistening with mucus and lined
with cilia. Its mouthparts are working violently, oozing a vile
greyish saliva. Everything goes quiet as the fly nestles onto the
altar and begins to feed on the sacrificial victim. It extends a long
proboscis, inserts it into the body of the victim and, with a
disgusting slurping sound, begins to suck up the organic juices.
It seems Baal has been here at some point, converting a group of
the superstitious dustbowlers to his cause. Turn to 258.

You whip out your blaster and fire, catching Achov in the arm.

You trigger a blast of superheated plasma and at this range,

you can tell, incredibly, that it is but temporary pain to him and
that he is taking no serious damage. Your blaster energy reading

Looking in you can see a stone altar at the far end of a large room. Upon it lies a translucent white triangle, giving off a faint white light, a part of the Rack. The floor in front of the altar is carved into a chequered grid of nine large stone slabs. Suddenly, there is a crunching sound above you. Looking up you can see the ceiling is being ripped open, and you can hear a snarling howl of ferocious fage - Baal is smashing his way in. You dash out onto the floor, knowing you must try to get the triangle before Baal breaks in. Make a Chance Roll.

You draw your blaster and burn the tentacles in two, but the section around your ankle continues to tighten, melting together. You stagger back, as unendurable agony rips through your body. It begins to absorb your foot, fusing with it and becoming a pulpy mass at the bottom of your leg. Suddenly two more tentacles burst out of it and wrap themselves around your thigh. Then they tear themselves away from the mass of your foot, forming jointed spider-like legs, ending in two barbed stings. The stings whip up and bury themselves into your chest, mercifully killing you instantly.

You spin aside and grab the sailor. Using his own momentum, you hurl him into the corner of the cabin. He slams into the wall with bone-shattering force, and slides to the floor motionless. However, the captain is upon you, and he slashes your arm. *Lose 4 Endurance points.* You grunt in agony but the pain galvanises you. You drive your fist into his solar plexus, driving the wind out of him. He doubles up, retching and you sprint up the stairs and out onto the deck, almost into the arms of a huge hairy sailor, lumbering towards the cabin. Wrestling with him is out of the question.

As you sit in your crash-couch, your Psychic Awareness begins
to register some kind of psionic phenomena within Falcon's
Wing. Turning around you can see that the three pieces of the
Rack are glowing brightly, radiating a white light that you
cannot look directly into. They begin to pulse faster and faster,
emanating waves of psychic energy. Examining these, you are
overjoyed to discover that they are transmitting the location of
the fourth piece of the Rack. You are forced to break contact
hurriedly, however. Being mentally linked to the incomplete
Rack is very uncomfortable, its psychic power is rooted in some
kind of machinery imbued with an unnatural half-life. The
whole feel of the thing is horribly alien. You pause as a wave of
nausea passes over you. Then, excitedly, you set co-ordinates
for the timehole on planet Chill, in 2985 AD, where the fourth
part of the Rack lies. You may lie in your Autodoc during the trip
and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance. Turn to 353.

Realising you cannot stand against him (yet), you dash away,
running as fast as you can for the Plaza outside. Baal gives a deep
throated rumbling growl, rising to a crescendo of roaring
thunder, raising the hackles on the back of your neck as you flee,
almost in abject terror. He smashes through the portal of the
room behind you, and begins to crash through the building
towards you. You are sprinting for the curtained entrance when
he crashes through a nearby wall and, picking up a large chunk
of rock, hurls it at you as if it were a pebble. Make an Evasion

You walk on up the corridor, further into the Dome, McReady
commentating as you go. You pass several doors on the left and
right, the crew's cabins. Then he shows you into a brightly lit
room with many precision instruments and worktops. A
primitive Autodoc lies in one corner. Tsu Tsang is working in
there and she nods as you come in. 'This is the lab,' says
McReady. 'A really ultra place. Old Tsu is testing a titanium
sample no doubt. Bet you're sick of the stuff, eh, Tsu?' Tsu
Tsang smiles weakly and works on. Leaving the lab, you are led
on down the corridor. It opens out on the right into a large
floorspace crammed with industrial machinery, and the corridor
continues on beyond it. Then it branches off into three. 'Down
there is where we store the titanium. Pretty non-ultra sight,'
says McReady, pointing to the left-hand corridor. 'Down to the
right are the generators, life support and that. Pretty ultra-less
as well. But straight ahead is the Mine Control, ultra man!' and
he leads you down it. It opens into a large room, lined with
complex instrument banks, computers and so on, making your
console in Falcon's Wing look like a toy. In one corner you can
see a large personal lift, presumably leading down into the mine
itself. Two men are seated at the console boards, running the
automated mining operation. 'Our Minetechs,' says McReady.
'Hey guys, meet our newcomer.' They look around, eyes
widening in surprise. One of them is a Siriun like Yelov, tall and
lithe, with long brown hair and golden cat-like eyes. He carries
himself as if he were thoroughly bored with mining. McReady

introduces him as Kepy Achov. The other is built like a tank,
about seven foot tall, bull-necked and bearded. His name is
Caleb. McReady tells you he is from Proxima Centauri, a high
gravity planet, which accounts for his size. They ask how you
got here and you chat to them for a while, making your story
sound convincing. Half an hour later, you are back in your cabin,
pondering on how you can get hold of the last piece of the Rack
without causing any disturbances in the timelines when you
hear a commotion outside. Turn to 365.

You burst into the light of the main street, the followers of Baal
close behind you. People step out of your way, indeed some

The heavy gravity is too strong for you and the axe slams into
your shoulder, virtually severing your arm. A gout of blood
spurts into the air and you pass out with shock. You never wake
up. You have failed.

248
You tell CAIN what happened on Cave. It reports that there
have been substantial changes in the history of Cave, caused by
Baal. 'In my opinion,' it goes on, 'Baal intended to rule over
Darkhome and, using advanced technology, extend his control
over the whole planet. From there he could breed a race of
genetically engineered star-warriors and make war on the

whole galaxy. But you have prevented that, Falcon, he will
never win any more support on Cave now. In any case, I would
compute that Baal is seriously worried about the possibility that
the Rack may be re-assembled.' If you have three pieces of the
Rack, turn to 241. If not, you have only one clue left, the
timehole on Dustbowl where Monitoring reported the timeline
disturbance. Turn to 287.

Bragg speaks, 'Right, it's it or us. We've got to hunt it down and
kill it, if we just wait it'll come for us in our sleep or individually.'
'I'm all for getting it now!' Caleb says aggressively.
'I agree,' says Bragg. 'Let's go and get the powersuits, Lieutenant
Falcon's battlesuit will be a great asset.' You all leave together,
headed for the air-lock strong room. Unfortunately, you
discover all of the powersuits, including your battlesuit, have
had their central processing units ripped out. Achov rifles
through the emergency spares box, 'Damn, the spares are gone
too!' The suits are useless without their computers to guide
them. You won't be able to leave the Dome until you find, the
suits' computer cartridges.
Bragg says: 'We'll just have to do without them. We'll flush it
out: Achov you take the right corridor. Lieutenant, you take the
centre corridor, but don't descend into the mine itself, that
would be too dangerous if it's there. I'll take the left tunnel. We'll
each take a short range radio on the same frequency. At the first
sign of trouble, pull back to the junction and radio for help.
Caleb can stay at the junction ready to move to anyone's aid.'
Bragg hands out the radios and you are given a flamethrower to
use. 'If we don't find it, then it's in the mine itself. We'll all go
down then and flush it out.' As you all head down the corridor
you nip into your cabin. Quickly you take out the tripod and
search for the Rack. You discover that it has been taken back to
the Cavern at the end of the mineshaft. You will have to go
down there after all despite Bragg's warning. Turn to 412.

Caleb says loudly, 'I think we should lock him up until the relief ship gets here, Braxton.'

You hurl several blasts of mental energy, dropping three of

splintered stone and Baal comes smashing through the portal
behind you, shattering rock and brick with great sweeping
blows. As the priests slam into you, Baal stretches both arms out towards you and twin balls of energy leap from his hands,
enveloping you and the priests in an inferno of flame. Death is
almost instantaneous.

255
Thinking quickly, you take the magnesite and hurl it into the
gaping maw. Then you use the flamethrower. There is a roar
and the magnesite catches, crackling with bright blue light.

You are unable to move as quickly as you would normally under

knocking you to the ground. Desperately, you struggle to your
feet but he is upon you. In a flash he has struck your head from
your shoulders. You have failed.

257
You hurl a blast of mental energy but, weakened though his
mental powers may be, it does not effect him and he laughs, a
deep shuddering sound that fills you with horror. He steps
forward, saying, 'You pathetic mortal, I will swat you like the
insect you are,' his voice filling your head, deep and melodious.
You realise that you cannot stand against him, yet. Seeing his
intention, you try to dodge the great scything sweep of his
hammer-like fist. Make an Evasion Roll.

After the hideous monstrosity has slaked its hunger it turns to
the congregation and, incredibly, speaks/the sound disturbingly
unnatural, human words not meant for an alien throat: 'The
words of Baal are these. Go forth and slay the Time Traveller,
for he would destroy you!' This fly being must be an ally of
Baal's, in fact your knowledge of ancient Earth history tells you
that thousands of years ago a demon known as Baal, Lord of the
Flies, was worshipped on Earth. Presumably the altar is some
kind of Variac Drive and inter-temporal communication device.
Then the fly being appears to stiffen. Its head swivels towards
you and your Psychic Awareness tells you that you are being
probed mentally. Will you:

Draw your blaster and try to kill the fly being and destroy the altar before making a run for it?

You race on, but the Warriors are gaining on you. It is growing
warmer down this tunnel and the light ahead is growing
brighter. Soon your suit coolant begins to circulate as the heat
rises dramatically. Your pursuers are slowing, they are not
accustomed to such heat, but they are doggedly following.
Suddenly you burst out into a dim white light, which seems
painfully bright after the gloomy green-tinged blackness of
Darkhome. You have emerged into a large natural cavern, silent
and undisturbed for centuries judging by the dust. Looking up
you see the roof of the cavern, far above. It is cracked and open
to the sky in places. Shafts of bright white light trickle down into
the blackness below, where it loses its intensity. Particles of dust
drift slowly in the light like planets in the vastness of space. Your
suit registers high levels of harmful radiation and you move on
towards another tunnel that leads out of the cavern. The five
Warriors burst in. Immediately, they cover their eyes, obviously
in great pain from the light, not only on their eyes, but burning
their skin too. Desperately they try to locate the tunnel you are
running into, but they cannot. As they blunder about, you rush
on. Having been given their orders they will try to follow your
path until they are dead. Soon the tunnel rejoins another and
you press onward leaving the Warriors far behind. Turn to 290.

The fly being realises who you are and lets out a burbling shriek,

you points and says: There is the Time Traveller in our very

your hand. You fire, playing the white-hot beam of your plasma
pistol over the fly beast and the altar. It shrivels up like paper and
the altar explodes, revealing masses of twisted instrumentation.
At this, the worshippers go into a frenzy of hatred. You cut
down several but they seem to be fearless and you are soon
overwhelmed and ripped limb from limb by the fanatical
worshippers of Baal.

The fireball erupts in the doorway, engulfing your legs
momentarily as you roll away. You are badly singed. Lose 6

suit, nor did we find any trace of a starship or any drive
emission. We would have picked it up on the sensors, normally.'
Bragg points his laser pistol at you, his eyes hard flints, 'Yes, Sil,
there was no trace of a starship. He could be the creature.' Caleb
backs away from you, readying his flamethrower. Achov draws
a short snub pistol, an old bullet-throwing weapon. You will
have to do some fast talking. What will you do:

Agent Bloodhound's face seems to come alive inside Falcon's
Wing. He nods a greeting at you, 'On line, Falcon. How's the
mission going? A tough one this, eh? Anyway, I have an
important message for you. We've picked up some strange
disturbances in the timelines of the timehole on Dustbowl. I've
just returned from a routine check there. Something appeared
and then left the Dustbowl timehole within a space of about one
hour. It caused a disturbance in the Winds of Time that is
completely unlike anything previously recorded and was of
great power. Monitoring is sure it was not a Variac Drive
emission. It could be Baal. That's all for now, Falcon. Good luck.
I'll hope to see you soon in the Rec Centre.'

A rocket surges up from your back-rack, slams into the fly
creature, and explodes ripping it into tiny glutinous bits. You jet
onward. The corridor stretches ahead for what seems like an
eternity. Then you can see a darker patch at its end. You shoot
out, to find yourself flying near the ceiling of an enormous
pillared vault. All around you at ceiling level is a circle of dark
niches, their contents indeterminable. There is an echoing roar
of rage and you look down. There, seated on an enormous
throne, cut from a single gigantic diamond over thirty feet in
size, is the powerfully muscled form of Baal. 'Curse you, mortal,
will you plague me for ever!' he screams. Then he notices that
you are holding the Rack. It is throbbing with an incredibly
bright light, so that it is painful to look on. For the first time, you
see fear on Baal's face. 'No!' he screams. He tries to hurl a yellow
fireball and he tries to exert his mental power, but he cannot do
either. Then he tries to fly up to you but he cannot even do that.
His face contorts with effort as he tries to travel in time but to
no avail. The Rack is preventing all his powers from working.
Quickly he bellows, 'Kill him!' From either side of you giant
flying creatures burst out of the small niches, filling the air with
a deafening humming. You recognise the fly-like creatures,
similar to the one you fought on Dustbowl. Will you:

green phosphorescence of the moss. The Warriors are gaining
on you as you burst out into another Darkhome farm. You are
following a path cutting through the middle of two lines of vats
fungus fields stretching away to either side. Some twenty
metres ahead is the yawning black hole of the exit. Thick blue
seams of some mineral line the walls above it. Some of the blue
mineral has fallen in a small pile of crumbled rock near the
entrance. Gasping for breath, the Warriors almost upon you,
you realise you won't make it. You'll have to turn and fight. Will

round in circles until it veers off in another direction. Still
maintaining your radio barrage, you get back to Falcon's Wing.
Quickly you fire your Particle Disruptor, severing the hausers
connected to Falcon's Wing and then get inside it. As far as
Captain Cresap Ord is concerned, when he draws up the
severed hauser, it will seem that you died in an unfortunate
accident. Turn to 260.

As you run back to the doorway you can hear a burbling shriek
as the fly being realises who you are. You hurl yourself through
the door into the silence of the night outside. You are forced to
release the guard under your control, but he does manage to
block the corridor for a brief moment. Suddenly, the quiet alley
is filled with the harsh, deafening cry of an electronic alarm. A
moment later and you can hear the sound of many running
footsteps; You have no choice but to flee. You dash down the
alleyway as ten or more black robed figures burst out of the
doorway. One of them points at you and says: 'It is the Time
Traveller! Kill him, in the name of Baal!' You sprint away. Turn

You have almost reached Falcon's Wing when some black-robed

into the hologram; it looks to them as if you have passed
through the wall of a house. Hurriedly, you set course for the
Eiger Vault. Then the cameras reveal Baal, recovered, hurtling
directly at you and your screens are filled with yellow flame as
he unleashes a fireball engulfing Falcon's Wing. You scream at
CAIN to engage the Variac Drive and, moments later, you
disappear from the city of Tenochtitlan. Safe in the grey
nothingness of null-space, you heave a sigh of relief, calming
your shattered nerves. Soon you are floating on the Winds of
Time headed for the Eiger Vault. You ask CAIN what has
happened in the timelines, knowing that the first law of TIME
has been broken on Tenochtitlan to an unprecedented degree. It
replies that the society was almost completely wiped out by the
Spaniards in a few more decades, thus cancelling any serious
time change. You may lie in your Autodoc and regain up to 12 points

alive, Braxton Bragg fires his laser pistol but the creature,
lowering its head, smashes through the door and is away.
Hurriedly you begin washing the acidic liquid off your leg, as
Bragg and Achov stand momentarily stunned at what has
happened. Bragg looks at you and says: 'Good work, Lieutenant.
What made you think it was him?'
'He didn't say "ultra" once in ten minutes,' you reply.
Bragg nods. 'Poor McReady, it must have got to him in the radio
room. If only I hadn't sent him there alone,' he says, ashenfaced. Turn to 250.

As you continue on, the twisting corridors carry an echo of
trilling Noble voices and a much deeper resonant booming trill.
Eventually, you come to the end of the tunnel without
encountering anything. Hanging back in the shadows of the
corridor you are able to survey the scene unseen. It is a large
cavern, obviously the centre of the rebel territory. Over a
hundred Warriors are standing in a tight block in the centre of
the chamber. Burrowers and other Worker types are busying
themselves with various tasks, digging, feeding the Warriors
and so on. Several Nobles are conferring with the strangest
sight of all in the far corner of the cavern. It is a huge pale
bulbous mass of blubbery flesh. A small head rests atop the
mass. This must be what a Caver Queen looks like. One of the
Nobles is speaking: The offensive is going well, Baal-Mother.
These devices you have given us,' pointing to a laser pistol, 'will
assure our victory. But we are worried, you have not yet laid a
Batch, is there something wrong, Mother? We are in need of
replacements.'
The huge mass speaks, with the deep resonant sound you heard

earlier: 'All in good time, Batch 16-A4-13. All in good time. Just
ensure my place as rightful Mother of Darkhome.' Your
attention wanders from this conversation when you notice a
stack of advanced machinery next to the bloated mass,
something that should not be here at this time. You also notice,
almost directly opposite you, a huge door, about eighteen feet in
height. It is of a shiny metal, and surrounded by domed lights
glowing dully. It is jarringly out of place in a culture that has not
yet discovered the wheel. As you look at the door you begin to
pick up some kind of psionic static from it. After a few minutes'
concentration, you are able to tell that the piece of the Rack you
are looking for lies behind the door! Do you have a piece of the
Rack with small circles at each of its three corners with you? If

You snatch up the glowing triangle, which has a small dark circle

back towards the portal, as bricks and mortar cascade into the
room. Before you have reached the doorway, Baal crashes
through the roof into the room and comes to his feet on the
floor. His weight sets off a trap and a volley of javelins fly at him,
but they shatter against his skin as if they were made of sand.

analyses the air, it will bear human life, but not for long as it
contains toxic substances. You find yourself in a well lit corridor
of polished steel. Thirty foot square curving away round a
corner. You jet around the corner to be greeted by a strange
sight. What can only be described as a twelve foot fly is hurtling
towards you up the corridor. You recognise it as it is almost
identical to the one that attacked you on Dustbowl. It is heading

You can hardly miss such a large target. You pour a sustained
blast of superheated plasma into the pale creature and it roars in
pain. Then the blubbery mass of the Mother begins to dissolve
before your very eyes, seemingly metamorphosing. Seconds
later, Baal stands in the Mother's place, bellowing in anger. With
a flash of insight, you realise he has been posing as a Cave .
Mother using his hallucinatory mind-powers, but your
concentrated blast of plasma, whilst it has not harmed him
seriously, has prevented him from maintaining the illusion. At
this, the Nobles order the Warriors to halt and begin trilling
agitatedly amongst themselves. They know they have been
tricked into rebelling against their rightful Mother and they see
Baal as an intruder now. Taking this opportunity, you sprint for
the door. However, Baal, furious, screams, 'You have meddled
in my plans too often, mortal. Your puny little organisation can
never hope to defeat me, Baal, the Lord of Flies!' and the sound
echoes around the chamber so that you can almost feel the floor
reverberating. Then he points at you, and a yellow bolt of

behind, you can see Baal e r u p t i n g from the building, leaving it a
mass of broken masonry. He soars into the air and speeds after
you. You are shocked to see that he has some means of natural
flight without wings, at his disposal, perhaps some form of

You step out into the Control Room. Caleb is waiting for you
there and he smiles a greeting. Then his eyes widen in surprise.
Suddenly, something sweeps across your legs, knocking you to
the ground. Looking around, you see a set of several long
human like arms, charred and burnt, heaving a bloated body out
from under the lift. It had been clinging to the bottom of the lift.
A crocodile head, jaws snapping, rears up above you, dripping
slimy juices. Caleb rushes in and sprays it with flame, giving you
time to scramble away. But then another spear of sharpened
bone lashes out from the creature, even as it burns. Caleb is too
slow to avoid it and it buries itself in his head, killing him
instantly. The bony spear detaches itself from the flaming mass
and begins to disappear into Caleb's body, transforming it.
Quickly you use your flamethrower. You burn it thoroughly,
making sure there is nothing left but charcoal. Then you use
your blaster to reduce the lift to molten metal, sealing anything
that may be left of the creature in the mine. Saddened by the
death of Caleb, who saved your life, you leave the Control

When the large blip on your radar display is over the tiny blip of
your rocket, you send out the detonation signal. There is no

effect, and the creature keeps coming. Either it was completely
unhurt, or, more likely, the weight of the dust contained the
explosion. Perhaps it did not even go off. It is almost upon you
now, turn to 197.

You reach out to Caleb's mind. You find his thought patterns
are human, he is not the creature. He grunts and says, staring at
you. 'What the hell are you doing to my mind? What are you?'
The rest turn to you, staring. Turn to 272.

You can feel that parts of the Rack are growing hot. Examining
them, you can see they are pulsing with white light, reacting to
the presence of Baal. Then you can feel an incredibly powerful
malevolent will, the mind of Baal, invading your mind. You
cannot stand against such force you realise. Baal smiles evilly.
But then the Rack segments begin to pulse faster and the power
of Baal's will lessens. His smile fades and he struggles to seize
your mind. His attack continues to fade, until you see him
struggling to use his mind powers, his face contorted with rage.
He bellows, 'So, you have half of the Rack! But now I will end
your petty existence, mortal.' His voice reverberates around the
room, almost deafening you. You realise that the two parts of
the Rack, acting together, are preventing him from using his
psychic power! He screams in rage, then he points at you and a
crackling ball of yellow energy explodes from his hand and
burns towards you. Thunderstruck by such natural power, you
hurl yourself out of the door in an attempt to avoid the fireball.

You set co-ordinates for Earth in 3033 AD and you are soon
surrounded by the grey nothingness of null-space. You may lie

in your Autodoc and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance during the
journey. You rematerialise in the Eiger Vault and whilst a TIME
maintenance team is replenishing Falcon's Wing's supply of
polybdenum, you instruct CAIN to link up with the Eiger
service computer to check for any news. CAIN reports that
nothing new has occurred during your visit to Rigel Prime. You
will have to continue your search. Which timehole will you
travel to:

You swim powerfully, but you can hold your breath no longer.
You realise you were swimming down, before panic takes you.
In a few seconds your lungs are filled. You have drowned in a sea
of dust.

You twist aside and the stinking spray of liquid splashes into the
wall behind you, where it streams and bubbles, eating into the
wall. You turn and fire again, but the creature, putting its head
down, smashes through the door and is away. Caleb and Achov
stand, stunned. Bragg looks at you and says: 'Good work,
Lieutenant. What made you think it Was him?'
'He didn't say 'ultra' once in ten minutes,' you reply.
Bragg nods. 'Poor McReady, it must have got him in the radio
room. I should never have sent him there alone.' Turn to 250.

You stop, panting heavily, and spin, drawing your blaster, the

they slash at you with their natural arsenal of weaponry.

The two Jaguar Knights stagger back and fall to the ground
under the effect of your Thinkstrikes. Their minds were
elsewhere, on the spectacle on the pyramid. No one notices their
fate and you dash through the curtained doorway into a
bewildering mass of corridors and large storerooms containing
stocks of maize, sculpted gold and so on. Eventually you come to
a wide corridor, lined with friezes, depicting scenes of Aztec
mythology. At its end is a richly decorated portal leading into a
large room. When you are nearer, you can see a large altar at the
end of the room. Upon it lies a translucent white triangle, small
circles embedded in each corner, giving off a bright white
radiance. It is a segment of the Rack. In between you and the
altar, the floor is a checkerboard of nine, six-foot-square stone
slabs, laid out in a square. Directly ahead of you lies the first
three.Will you:
Step out onto the left hand slab?
The middle slab?

You reach out for McReady's mind, but you cannot find
anything you would normally consider a mind. His thought
patterns are alien and strange, driven by simple principles,
survival, multiplying, growing, eating. With horror you draw
back as you realise the creature knows you have probed it. 'It's
McReady!' you shout. Turn to 401.

313
You turn and set a mental fix on the leading pursuer. You
unleash a blast of mental energy and your target goes down like
a sack of potatoes. Concentrating hard you repeat the process
several times. Your pursuers come to a halt, almost as one.
Some lie unconscious, others are holding their heads. Passerbys
stare in horror and then hurry on. You can hear your pursuers
muttering amongst themselves about 'sorcery' and 'magic'.

They are a superstitious group and they seem disinclined to
chase you after your display of power. Indeed some of them,
unsure as to whether their prone comrades are still alive, are
beginning to scuttle away. Seizing your chance, you run
onwards and they are soon lost to sight. Moments later you are
back in the warehouse containing Falcon's Wing, running to the
crates marked 'Eiger Corporation'. Have you seen a man with a
tattoo on his forearm here on Dustbowl? If you have, turn to
350. If you have not, turn to 399.

You step out onto the wooded surface of Benner's Hill. The
trees are obscuring your vision now, but you can hear the sound
of men taking up a position south-west of you. Nearby are the
crumpled bodies of several men in blue uniforms, Unionists.
Quickly you set up the Rack detector and the gem begins to
glow. Sifting through its psychic emanations you can find no
trace of the Rack or any parts of it. Disappointed, you are
packing it up when your Psychic Awareness registers the
presence of someone with advanced mental powers on the
north face of Benner's Hill. Will you:
Investigate this psionic presence?
Leave for another timehole immediately?

Those behind crash into the tangled mass of bodies and are
thrown into confusion. You have a few seconds' respite. Will

Baal-Mother?

You hurl a blast of mental energy but it has no effect, it either
doesn't have enough of a mind to be affected or is immune to
Psychic Attack. Its jaw rips through your battlesuit, and takes
your arm off, your suit collapses under the pressure of the dust

and you are crushed to death before you can suffer the horror of
being eaten alive.

317
Hoping the mineral is magnesite, you unleash a blast of superhot plasma onto the pile of rocks. The reaction is instantaneous.
The rock explodes, crumbling in the heat and producing an
unbearable incandescent flare of bright blue light. Your face
plate flash damper protects your eyes, but the Warriors are
blinded instantly. It is an easy task to finish them with your
blaster. They try to find you using their sense of smell, but you
are able to make your escape. You may take some magnesite
with you, if you wish. You leave the farm and press on down the
tunnel ahead. Turn to 290.

318
You swim powerfully for what you hope is the surface. Then
your head breaks through the dust, into the air. Clinging to a
nearby iron stanchion that supports the quayside you clear the
dust from your face. Hiding behind the iron pillars, you make
your way down the side of the quay, struggling through the
dust, your filter mask working overtime. When you are out of
sight of the Winged Demon, you climb up one of the stanchions
to the harbourside and make your way to Falcon's Wing where
you decide to wait until the Winged Demon has left on another
whaling expedition, so you can find another ship. You instruct
CAIN to disguise Falcon's Wing as a pile of whaling equipment
to avoid the prying eyes of anyone in search of the scientist's
diving bell. You may lie in you Autodoc if you wish, and gain up to
6 points of lost Endurance. Turn to 342.

Your Thinkstrike has no effect at all It has 'nothing you can

You can feel that the section of the Rack is growing hot in your
hand and, examining it, you see it is pulsing with white light,
reacting to the presence of Baal. Then you can feel an incredibly
powerful malevolent will, the mind of Baal, invading your mind.

You cannot stand against such force, you realise, and Baal smiles
evilly. But then the Rack segment begins to pulse faster and the
power of Baal's will lessens. His smile fades and he struggles to
seize your mind. You realise that the rack segment is dampening
Baal's psychic power. You fight back, his will is strong but so is
yours. Make a Power of Will Roll.

You reach out to Achov's mind. You find his thought patterns
are similar to a human's, obviously he is what he looks to be, a
Siriun, and not the creature. Achov starts and stares at you:
'What are you... ? By the gods, you're a psionic!' he exclaims,
and the rest turn to you in amazement. Turn to 272.

322
You throw yourself into the air, but the slab of masonry
ricochets off your side, sending you hurtling through the
doorway. Lose 9 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you struggle
to your feet, Baal close behind, and stagger on. Turn to 299.

323
You open up with the blaster and it claims the lives of several
Warriors but the rest rush on heedlessly. You are overwhelmed
and literally cut into pieces.

324
Desperately, you push yourself on, legs pumping like pistons.
Soon your vigorous training pays off and you leave your
pursuers behind. A few moments later and they are lost to sight
as you turn into the dark foreboding street where the
warehouse containing Falcon's Wing lies. As you approach the
entrance four black-robed figures burst from the shadows and
charge at you in silence, drawing long wickedly curved daggers
as several more step out of buildings behind you, trapping you in
the street. Obviously they knew a short cut. Acting instinctively, you hurl yourself, rolling, at the feet of your four
assailants, hoping to trip them and run on into the safety of
Falcon's Wing. Make an Evasion Roll.

Slowly you creep down to the north side of the hill. As you
descend, blaster in hand, you can see someone crouching behind
a tree, their back to you. Whoever it is has a strong psychic
presence and is hiding from someone or something further
down at the base of the hill. The crouched figure appears to be a
young Confederate soldier, dressed in homespun butternut,
with grey trousers. It seems the Confederates were not able to
clothe their soldiers properly. Suddenly the figure stiffens and
then whirls, a blaster in its hand, pointing at you! Will you:
Shoot to kill?

You draw your blaster and fire in one smooth motion. A bolt of
plasma slams into McReady's leg, smashing him against the
door. He howls, an unearthly, inhuman sound, and his eyes roll
up into his head. Suddenly a small suppurating hole appears in
his neck, opening and closing spasmodically. His skull splits open
with a loud wet crack and something large and bulky shudders
forth, forming into a heavy head, horned and armoured, two
small pig-like eyes at each side, the whole thing spilling rivulets
of reddish mucus. Horrified, Achov, Bragg and Caleb hesitate.
McReady's shoulders split apart and a bony carapace forms over

them. Then a thin jet of dirty white liquid hisses from the hole in
the neck and streams toward you. Desperately you try to avoid
it. Make an Evasion Roll.

You manage to control the Nobles. Instantly you force them to

their laser-pistols at the Baal-Mother, who is shouting in rage. It
writhes in pain as you force the Nobles to keep up their lancing
fire. Then the blubbery mass of the Mother begins to dissolve
before your very eyes, seemingly metamorphosing. Seconds
later, Baal stands in the Mother's place, bellowing in anger. With
a flash of insight, you realise he has been posing as a Cave
Mother using his hallucinatory mind-powers, but the needlelike pulses of the Noble's lasers, whilst not harming him
seriously, have shaken him, preventing him from maintaining
the illusion. Taking this opportunity, you release the Nobles and
sprint for the door. The Nobles stare at Baal and begin trilling
agitatedly amongst themselves. They know they have been
tricked into rebelling against their rightful Mother and they see
Baal as an intruder now. However, Baal, furious, screams, 'You
have meddled in my plans too often, mortal. Your puny little
organisation can never hope to defeat me, Baal, the Lord of
Flies!' and the sound echoes around the chamber so that you can
almost feel the floor reverberating. Then he points at you, and a
yellow bolt of energy forks from his finger, crackling through
the air towards you. You must try to dodge the attack. Make an
Evasion Roll.

darkness of an alien world.

Moments later you are back in Falcon's Wing. Where will you go

A day later you leave Falcon's Wing in the hope of finding an
alternative to the Winged Demon. Carefully examining the
quayside, you are pleased to see that the Winged Demon has left

someway from it when your Psychic Awareness picks up the
presence of somebody nearby. You are prepared when three
sailors run out at you from behind a large crate, long daggers in
their hands. One of them hisses: 'This time Baal will have your

against the tree with a crash and then flops to the ground,
lifeless, the torso a smoking black mass. You walk over to the
body and roll it over with your foot. A chill of horror seizes you.
It is Agent Lynx, one of your comrades and you have killed her.
Transfixed with guilt and remorse you fail to hear anything
until you feel the cold barrel of a blaster at the back of your neck.
Thank you for doing the work for me, Falcon. Now my revenge
will indeed be complete. Goodbye.' You have time to recognise
the voice of the arch traitor, Agidy Yelov, before he squeezes the
trigger, ending your life. You have failed.

You pull the trigger, but there is no effect. It has been damaged
by the creature's jaws. Horrified, you can do nothing as the
creature bites through your battlesuit and takes your arm off,
your suit collapses under the pressure of the dust and you are
crushed to death before you can suffer the horror of being eaten
alive.

You draw and fire in one swift moment, but Achov is a Siriun

You are some twenty metres from Falcon's Wing when a loud
humming fills the air, as if of a thousand bees in flight. Turning

your head you see the fly beast, the servant of Baal, whirring
into the warehouse: 'You must die, Time Traveller, Baal has
spoken,' it bubbles revoltingly, and darts downwards, intent on
devouring you. Will you:

knee into your head, just under the chin, killing you instantly.

Suspecting some kind of trap, you edge your way carefully onto

353
When you rematerialise, all the camera reveals is a dirty white
expanse, tinged with pink, visibility is almost zero. You have
arrived in a storm and sheets of hail are driving against your
Time Machine, clattering against the hardened hull. You ask
CAIN for information on Chill in 2985. 'Well, Falcon, the planet
Chill is a ball of rock rich in minerals covered in a crust of ice. It is
one of the coldest planets man has yet discovered. It is devoid of
life and the atmosphere is ammonia based. However, at this
time, only forty years ago from our time, there is a small mining
station, mostly automated, run by a crew of five men. They are
working a rich bed of titanium, used in many starship hulls.
Incidentally Falcon, the Manager, Braxton Bragg, was a good
friend of your grandfather's, your grandmother was Bragg's
sister, so be careful. You will have to wear the battlesuit, your
environment suit will not be enough to keep out the cold,
Falcon. I will run up some stencils in the Molecular Convertor,
you can paint on the insignia of the Federation Planetary

Exploration Scouts. If you should run across the miners, you can
pretend to a be a shipwrecked scout, crash-landed on Chill.
Remember, Time Travel won't be discovered for another thirty
years.'
Thank you CAIN,' you reply. When you are ready you step out
into the freezing atmosphere of Chill. Looking around, you can
see a rugged landscape of twisted ice ridges and valleys. Setting
the Rack detector, you soon discover the location of the last
piece of the Rack. With the other three pieces of the Rack in your
battlesuit utility containers, you set off towards it. The
buffeting cross winds caused by the storm are too strong for
you to use your jets, but you take great leaping strides, your
battlesuit servos whining. Hailstones as large as your fist are
battering against your armour and your instrument readout
tells you that the suit is working overtime to ward off the deadly
cold. Turn to 94.

354
There is a loud woosh and a six foot barbed harpoon whirs over
your head and crashes into the wall of the poopdeck, just above
the captain's door. In an instant you are up and running down
the gangplank, soon to be lost amongst the crates and
equipment piled up everywhere on the harbourside. You return
to Falcon's Wing where you decide to wait until the Winged
Demon has left on another whaling expedition, so you can find
another ship. You instruct CAIN to disguise Falcon's Wing as a
pile of whaling equipment to avoid the prying eyes of anyone in
search of the scientist's diving bell. You may lie in your Autodoc
if you wish, and gain up to 6 points of lost Endurance. Turn to 342.

355
You follow Brax and Caleb to the Rec Room, wondering where
the Rack piece is. You will have to wait until you can determine
its location, it looks like it could be dangerous around here for a
while anyway. In the Rec Room, Braxton says, 'We'll have to
devise some means of testing that we're all human.' The door
opens and Achov comes in, wheeling a trolley carrying five gastanks with tube-like extensions, the flamethrowers. One of
them is painted red and blue.
Caleb rises to his feet and takes it. 'My thrower,' he says. A few
minutes later, McReady enters the room, standing near the
door.

'Well?' Braxton asks impatiently.
'It has been smashed, the deep space radio, everything gone. The
creature got to it already,' he says, his voice deadpan and
toneless as he stands, completely still, gazing placidly at Bragg.
There is silence in the room. Braxton is deep in thought, Caleb
polishes his flamethrower, Achov stares at the floor, his fingers
drumming rhythmically on the table, and McReady stands
unmoving at the door, his face a blank. Will you:

minds to find out if one of them is the alien? Turn to 335

The blaster is pointing straight at you, but you recognise the
face of Agent Lynx. She says, 'Falcon! What are you doing here?'
You move closer and tell her of your mission and then ask her
what she is up to. 'Well, Falcon, as you know, Jobanque assigned
me to trace Yelov. I've found him. He's about forty yards down
the hill behind that clump of trees. I have him pinned down.
With your help, we can almost certainly get him. You could walk
around behind him.' It still disturbs you to think of Yelov as
alive. As far as your memory is concerned, you saw him die by
your hand, but you also know that never happened, due to a
time paradox. Before you or Lynx can act, there is a sudden
barrage of explosions. The Union or the Confederates are
shelling Benner's Hill. You crouch low and then the tree you are
sheltering behind is vaporised by a bolt of plasma and you are
both forced to throw yourself to the ground. You can see Yelov
taking this opportunity to escape. He, too, is dressed in grey.
Lynx looks disappointed. 'Blast it, Falcon, we had him! Falcon,
listen, I know your mission is important, but I could use your
help here. It'll probably only be for a couple of hours. How about
it?' Will you:
Say: 'I'm sorry Lynx, I can't,' wish her good
luck and go in search of the Rack?
Stay and give Lynx a hand against Yelov?

357
You have fired too high in your panic and the bolt of plasma

shoots over the creature where its head should have been. The
tentacles round your thigh, reel you in, you are clasped to its
torso and you arm is bitten off by the gaping maw. More
tentacles writhe around your chest, and they eat into you,

'What in the galaxy was that thing?' says McReady. Caleb points
to an insignia still visible on the clothing sticking to the burning
mass. In an incredulous tone, he says, 'It was Tsu Tsang,' you
say breathlessly, explaining what had happened to her.
'Whatever it was in the egg must have been still alive somehow.'
They are stunned into silence for a moment.
Bragg says, 'It must be able to replicate the genetic pattern of
whatever it absorbs, mimicking its victim precisely. It can
change its form at will, obviously, and it can act in separate units,
judging by the severed leg. Presumably its cells can reproduce
themselves at an alarming rate.' He pauses for a moment. 'That
means it or other parts of it could still be alive, somewhere. In
fact it could even be one of us, it's had plenty of time to absorb
and duplicate somebody since we've been asleep.'
'Oh wow, man,' whimpers McReady, his eyes darting from face
to face, Achov's brow furrows, his yellow eyes narrowing.
Caleb grunts, 'Not Lieutenant Falcon anyway,' he says. 'It just
tried to kill him.' The flames begin to peter out, leaving charred
remains.
'At least we know it can be killed with fire,' says Bragg. 'Right,
everyone into the Rec Room, let's get out of this stinking hole,'
and he turns to McReady. 'Go to the radio room and contact the
communication satellite, tell 'em to get some troopers down
here and a relief ship, fast! Achov, go to stores and get the
flamethrowers we use for clearing ice off the Dome. See you in
the Rec Room in a few minutes.' Turn to 355.

359
The Rec Room is where the crew eat, rest and play. Several vidbooths line one wall as does a large nutritional dispenser.
Various personal effects and pieces of machinery lie hap-

hazardly about. A holo-viewer is on hold, the small projected
figures frozen in place - it looks like some kind of horror-holo
feature, possibly a holo-nasty. The machine is labelled 'Kepy
Achov's - keep off!'. Absently, you note that the holo-cassette is
called 'Night of the Star-Vampires'. Two people, one an oriental
of slim build, with the insignia of a medtech on her overalls, the
other a heavily built, neat looking man, with a carefully trimmed
beard and thick black hair are seated at a long table. They look up
in astonishment at the sight of you, they probably haven't seen
another human face for weeks. You tell them your story and the
bearded man says, 'I see. You're lucky to have survived. I'm
Braxton Bragg, the manager, you can call me Brax. This is Tsu
Tsang, our Medic and general boffin,' and he indicates the
oriental woman next to him. 'It looks like you'll be stuck here
until the Relief Ship arrives, I'm afraid. That will be about two
weeks from now. It'll cost too much to send a starship just for
you! Tsu Tsang will show you your cabin and then you can come
back here. We haven't spoken to anyone else for two months you'll be a welcome change,' and he smiles warmly at you.
Tsu Tsang walks over to you, and you notice she is limping. She
says tersely, 'Drill bit fell on my foot two weeks ago, broke it
badly.' She shows you into a tiny cabin with a single bunk, a few
doors on from the Rec Room. It is opposite a large room. 'Make
yourself at home,' she says wryly and leaves. A minute later,
there is a knock at the door and Sil McReady comes in.' Hi, Brax
asked me to show you around if you'd like? Its a pretty ultra
place, or it was at first! I'm getting ultra sick of it now.' You
decide to agree as you'll need to find out if the Rack is near,
despite having to listen to McReady's obsessive use of the word
'ultra'. Turn to 244.

Gingerly you edge out onto the slab. A thrill of horror runs up

You race on. It is growing warmer down this tunnel and the
light ahead is growing brighter. Soon your suit coolant begins to
circulate as the heat rises dramatically. Suddenly you burst out
into a dim white light, which seems painfully bright after the
gloomy green-tinged blackness of Darkhome. You have
emerged into a large natural cavern, silent and undisturbed for
centuries judging by the dust. Looking up you see the roof of the
cavern, far above. It is cracked and open to the sky in places.
Shafts of bright white light trickle down into the blackness
below, where it loses its intensity. Particles of dust drift slowly
in the light like planets in the vastness of space. Your suit
registers high levels of harmful radiation and you move on
towards another tunnel that leads out of the cavern. Turn to
290.

363
You grab a middle-aged man in brown robes with a grey cap and
ask him to call the police. He looks up at you in surprised
outrage. 'How dare you,' he says. Then he notices your
pursuers, his expression changes and he says, 'I can't help you,
Offworlder, leave me alone,' and he hurries on. They are almost
upon you now. Will you:

Turn to 313
Turn to 334

Use your blaster?
Thinkstrike them?
Sprint onwards?

364
There is a whoosh and the six-foot, rocket-propelled harpoon
leaves the gun and rips into your abdomen. You are lifted into
the air and carried across the deck. The harpoon slams into the
wall of the poop deck, pinning you to it just above the captain's
door. A few seconds later you are dead.

365
Looking out, you can see Caleb and Achov running into the Rec
Room and you follow them in. There is an air of excitement, as
Achov speaks rapidly. 'Brax, the Autodrill has uncovered a large
cavern, deep in the rock. I've never seen anything like it. We
went down and had a look, we found these.' And he puts two
objects onto the table. One is a strange leathery egg, about the
size of a football. The other sends a rush of adrenalin through

your blood - it is the final piece of the Rack. 'Not only that, there
is a circular shaft leading from the cavern roof right up through
a mile of rock, up to the ice. Can't be natural. Looks like it's some
remains of the Ancient's culture, the Federation'll pay through
the nose to examine it. We're as good as rich.'
Braxton Bragg looks at them thoughtfully. 'You could be right
Achov, this egg could be a real find; bit weird though, isn't it?'
'Yeah, really ultra, man,' McReady chips in to be answered by
several irritated glares.
'We'll get Tsu Tsang to examine it.' Braxton Bragg continues.
'Here, Achov, take it to her, and then get back to work, the
Mining Company doesn't pay you to sit around!' He laughs.
When they have gone, Braxton eyes you speculatively, Tunny a
Fed Scout should turn up at the same time as we find this, eh?'
'Yes, an amazing coincidence, isn't it,' you reply and he smiles.
You decide to return to your cabin and wait for night to fall and
the crew to sleep. Then you can creep into the lab, take the Rack
and leave, they'll think it's all some secret government
operation. At any rate, it seems Baal is not here in person, as on
Cave and Tenochtitlan. Turn to 413.

You dive aside, but the horned bone gashes your arm, burning

behind you. Turn to 392.

367
'Okay Lynx, I'll help. What do you think he's up to?'
Thanks Falcon, I can certainly use it! Well, at the moment, Yelov
just seems to be trying to avoid being caught, but there is one
thing he could do here today. The Union forces are pretty
demoralised at the moment. In about an hour General Lee will
order General Ewell, the commander of the Confederate forces
on this flank, to launch an attack, if possible. Culp's Hill is
unoccupied at the moment, it will be held by Union troops later,
but if Ewell was to take it now... Historically, Ewell decided not

to attack, but if he had, it is almost certain the rest of the Union
army would have been routed, and the Confederacy would have
won Gettysburg. My guess is that Yelov will try to force Ewell
to order an attack using mind control. Imagine if the
Confederacy had won the Civil War, Falcon? There would be
two nations in America, history would be changed radically and
we might never exist! This would be revenge enough for Yelov.
Let's head for Ewell's HQ and await developments.' Will you:
Go with Lynx?

368
Moving fast, you take the sharpened bone and hack the
tentacles in two, cutting it away from your foot before it can
take hold and leap back out of range from the suppurating beast.
Then the creature sprouts four massive trunk-like legs, raising
it off the ground. It folds in on itself, metamorphosing into a
single huge mouth on legs, two lobster-like eyestalks rising
above it. Do you have any magnesite with you? If you do, turn
to 255. If you do not, turn to 267.

You slam into the legs of three of them and they fly over you,
crashing to the ground. In an instant you are up, but the fourth
whips his dagger across, gashing your shoulder as he shouts,
'Die, in the name of Baal!' Lose 2 Endurance points. Controlling your
shocked surprise at this, you unleash a Thinkstrike and he
staggers back, holding his head. Barging past him you dart into
the warehouse, running for the crate marked 'Eiger Corporation'. Turn to 350.

A tentacle whips out, slapping your hand to one side so that the
bolt of plasma discharges into the wall with a crash like a clap of

agonisingly as you realise the slime that coats it is eating into
your flesh. Lose 3 Endurance points and subtract 1 from your Evasion

You twist to the side but the laser beam drills into your
battlesuit. Subtract 1 from your battlesuit armour points, but you are
unhurt. To your horror you realise it has damaged your
environmental control unit. If that should fail, your suit will be
unable to maintain any heat and you will freeze to death in
seconds in this cold. Your rocket surges towards its target.
Desperately, the creature tries to dodge it, but the rocket homes
in and explodes, smearing the powersuit and its contents across
the ridge, where it freezes instantly, completely inert. All that is
left is a broad red stain, frozen solid. Exhausted, you pick
yourself up and use your jets to fly back to Falcon's Wing. Turn
to 262.

372
The adobe hut disguising Falcon's Wing is only yards ahead of
you when a black shadow falls over you. Looking up you can see

You head down the gloomy tunnels illuminated by the green
phosphorescence of the moss. Soon you come out into another
Darkhome farm. You are following a path cutting through the
middle of two lines of vats, fungus fields stretching away to
either side. Some twenty metres ahead is the yawning black hole
of the exit. Thick blue seams of some mineral line the walls
above it. Some of the blue mineral has fallen in a small pile of
crumbled rock near the entrance. Picking the rock up, you are
able to identify it as magnesite. You may keep some if you wish.
Note it on your Agent Profile. Leaving the farm area you
continue on in search of the Rack section. Turn to 290.

A white-hot stream of superheated plasma flies into the mass of
men pursuing you and you play the beam across them. There

they had run into a brick wall. People stop and stare in horror
backing away from you. You run on leaving the tangled knot of
men behind you. As you turn into the dark foreboding street
where the warehouse containing Falcon's Wing lies, you can
hear the sound of sirens, presumably the local police. Quickly
you dart into the warehouse and run toward the crates marked

forearm here on Dustbowl ? If you have, turn to 350. If you have
not, turn to 399.

Your breathing becomes rapid and you stare in horror and begin

pain shocks you back into reality. You must defend yourself as

horn, bursts out of its mouth, extending toward you with the

The stream of superheated plasma takes Baal full in the chest.
At this, the people around you flee in terror, some screaming
that the gods are doing battle in the streets of Tenochtitlan. You
maintain the stream of plasma, and it showers over Baal, who
roars in rage and pain. Then incredibly, Baal begins to move
through the air towards you, slowly but surely moving against

the white-hot plasma that splashes like lightning across his
chest. Amazed that anything can withstand such energy you are
about to run in fear when Baal begins to show signs of strain.
The plasma is getting through. The nimbus of yellow energy
begins to flicker on and off. Then he drops out of the sky and
slams into the floor of the plaza, his impact cracking the
stonework. He lies there bellowing in rage as he struggles up,
the yellow nimbus slowly re-forming around him. Awed, you
realise he is only stunned and you run for Falcon's Wing, noting
that your blaster energy pack is completely depleted. You will be
unable to use it until you can fit another energy pack in Falcon's
Wing. Turn to 285.

A bolt of superheated plasma shoots into the writhing hole of
what was Tsu Tsang's chest with a blinding flash, hurling the
creature backward. It crashes to the floor and erupts into
flames. Threshing wildly about, it roars in pain, bits of flaming
flesh popping and spluttering. A leg, still human in form, rolls
away twitching. You watch incredulously as six jointed
insectoid legs sprout from either side of the leg, cracking
outwards to the floor, and the foot mutates, lengthening and
splitting open to reveal rows of teeth, forming some kind of
malformed crocodile head. Just then the door slams open and
the rest of the mining crew, headed by Bragg, come in. They
stop horrified at what they see, babbling incoherently. McReady
leans away and is violently sick. The crocodile insect scuttles
toward you and leaps. You are about to blast it when Bragg fires
a laser pistol neatly dissecting it. Both halves hit the floor and
begin to inch together, a tentacle whips out joining the two
sections. Bragg stands astonished, unable to act. Quickly you
bathe it in plasma and it starts to burn. The lab begins to fill with
acidic smoke. Turn to 358.

You are examining the door when your mind picks up a mental
probe, coming from the large mass of flesh. Suddenly a mind of

Together you leave the hill. There is a pause in the battle; both
sides are tired and the day's fighting is virtually over. You walk
past groups of exhausted and wounded men, artillery batteries,
field hospitals and so on. It is all very confused as far as you can
make out. No one challenges you and soon you are behind
Ewell's Command Post, a small building on the outskirts of
Gettysburg. Ewell is sitting at its front. He has lost a leg and the
stump is obviously paining him. Eventually, a courier on
horseback arrives, with orders from General Lee. Both you and
Lynx tense expectantly. As soon as General Ewell has read
them, your Psychic Awareness tells you that Yelov is exerting
his will from inside the house. You both decide to use your
Power of Will on Yelov simultaneously. He is taken by surprise,
but Yelov recognises that you are with Lynx and his hatred of
you gives him added strength of will. He throws your mental
attack aside, but Ewell is now unaffected at any rate. Suddenly,
Yelov bursts out around the corner of the house. You stand
stock still for a moment, a prickly chill of fear running up your
spine. As far as you are concerned, the last time you saw Yelov
he was dead at your feet. To see him alive like this is disturbing,
even though you knew you never really killed him, due to a
puzzling time paradox. His cybernetic arm gleams in the falling
light as he raises it to smash you, shouting: 'At last Falcon, I'll see
you dead!' You must try to dodge the blow. Make an Evasion

around to make sure you were not spotted using an illegal

You dart into the lift and press the button for the Mining
Control Room. The lift begins to move. Suddenly it shudders
for a second but starts to rise upwards quickly again. Then your
radio crackles and Bragg's voice comes out of it: 'It's clear in the
storage area. How about you, Lieutenant Falcon?' You tell him
what's happened, leaving out any mention of the Rack. He
replies: 'You fool! You could've been killed!'
Before he can go on, Achov's voice cuts in over the radio. 'I've
found the suit computer control chips! They were in the main
generator room. I'm coming out now, I'll meet you at the
corridor junction.' A few minutes later the lift comes to a stop.
Do you have Caleb's flamethrower? If you do, turn to 200. If

You have misjudged how close your pursuers were. You
unleash a blast of superheated plasma that virtually vaporises
two of them but another slams into you, wielding a wickedly
curved dagger. Acting instinctively, you fall backwards underneath him and use your foot to throw him over your head.
However, another slashes your arm as you roll to your feet. *Lose 6 Endurance points.* If you are still alive, you despatch him with a
swift karate kick, driving him back into those behind him. This
gives you enough time to run on. They seem hesitant to follow
you now, and soon you have left them behind. A few moments
later and they are lost to sight as you turn into the dark,
foreboding street where the warehouse containing Falcon's
Wing lies. As you approach the entrance four black-robed
figures burst from the shadows and charge at you in silence,
drawing long wickedly curved daggers as several more step out
of buildings behind you, trapping you in the street. Obviously
they knew a short cut. Acting instinctively, you hurl yourself,
rolling, at the feet of your four assailants, hoping to trip them
and run on into the safety of Falcon's Wing. Make an Evasion

'Okay,' Lynx says. After going back to Falcon's Wing to pick up
your hologram detector, you use it to check for any signs of a
Hologram. You find Lynx's machine close to yours, but then you
detect a hologram, obviously Yelov's stolen model A3, on the
left bank of Culp's Hill, east of Benner's Hill and make your way
towards it. You pass a battery of horse artillery straining to pull
a gun out of some mud, and several groups of soldiers, tired and
wounded. Soon you come to a body of Confederate infantry,
behind the cover of a low stone wall. You are just about to

black limbs glistening with mucus and lined with cilia. Its
mouthparts are working violently, oozing a vile greyish saliva.
Incredibly it speaks, the sound disturbingly unnatural, human

words not meant for an alien throat: 'You must die, Time
Traveller, Baal has spoken,' it bubbles. A wave of disgust comes

You must try to get through the door. You are edging around
the edge of the cavern when your Psychic Awareness tells you
that someone with mental powers has detected your mind. The
Mother bellows loudly and the Nobles spin round, ordering
twenty Warriors to kill you. The Warriors start moving towards
you. Then a powerful mind attacks yours. You recognise the
mental power of Baal. Suddenly the pieces of the Rack you are
holding begin to grow hot and pulse brightly with white light
and Baal's mind is driven back. Then the blubbery mass of the
Mother begins to dissolve before your very eyes, seemingly
metamorphosing. Seconds later, Baal stands in the Mother's
place, bellowing in anger. With a flash of insight, you realise he
has been posing as a Cave Mother using his hallucinatory mindpowers, but the two pieces of the Rack, acting together, prevent
Baal from using his mental ability. At this, the Nobles order the
Warriors to halt and begin trilling agitatedly amongst themselves. They know they have been tricked into rebelling against
their rightful Mother and they see Baal as an intruder now.
Taking this opportunity, you sprint for the door. However,
Baal, furious, screams: 'You have meddled in my plans too often,
mortal. Your puny little organisation can never hope to defeat
me, Baal, the Lord of Flies!' and the sound echoes around the
chamber so that you can almost feel the floor reverberating.
Then he points at you, and a yellow bolt of energy forks from his
finger, crackling through the air toward you. You must try to
dodge the attack. Make an Evasion Roll.

McReady's eyes roll up into his head. Suddenly a small
suppurating hole appears in his neck, opening and closing

spasmodically. His skull splits open with a loud wet crack and
something large and bulky shudders forth, forming into a heavy
head, horned and armoured, two small pig-like eyes at each side,
the whole thing spilling rivulets of reddish mucus. Horrified,
Achov and Caleb hesitate. McReady's shoulders split apart and a
bony carapace forms over them. Then a thin jet of dirty white
liquid hisses from the hole in the neck and streams towards you,
Bragg and Achov. Almost as one you duck. Caleb raises the
flamethrower, but McReady's side bursts open and a length of
ridged, slime-ridden bone shoots out with devastating speed and
buries itself in Caleb's chest. He howls in agony as, in front of
your eyes, the bone begins to fuse with Caleb, retracting slowly,
drawing him to the thing. Achov, Braxton and you open fire in

As cautiously as you can, you steal out onto the slab. A surge of
adrenalin flows through you as the slab shifts and there is a loud
click, below your feet. Will you:
Leap forward?
Drop to the floor?

Desperately, you throw your most powerful blast of mental
energy at the creature, but it has no effect, you can sense it has
no mind at least not what you would call a mind. You utter a
shriek of revulsion as a tentacle snakes wetly around your thigh.
Your leg begins to burn agonisingly as you realise the slime that
coats it is eating into your flesh. Lose 3 Endurance points and subtract 1
from your Evasion Modifier permanently as the wound will never heal
properly. If you still live, you whip out your blaster as fast as you
can and fire at the thing as it writhes in front of you. Make an
Attack Roll.

You twist to the side and the laser beam lances past you, to be
lost in the uniformly grey expanse of the Chill sky. Your rocket
surges towards its target. Desperately the creature tries to
dodge it, but the rocket homes in and explodes, smearing the
powersuit and its contents across the ridge, where it freezes
instantly, completely inert. All that is left is a broad red stain,
frozen solid. Exhausted you pick yourself up and use your jets to
fly back to Falcon's Wing. Turn to 100.

407
A day later you leave Falcon's Wing in the hope of finding an
alternative to the Winged Demon. Carefully examining the
quayside, you are pleased to see that the Winged Demon has left
and that another ship is moored at the harbour. You are still
some way from it when your Psychic Awareness picks up the
presence of somebody nearby. You are prepared when three
sailors run out at you from behind a large crate, long daggers in
their hands. One of them hisses, 'May Baal, Lord of Flies, have
your soul Time Traveller!' You contain your shocked surprise
and prepare to defend yourself. It seems Baal has managed to
establish some kind of priesthood on this planet, perhaps the
very religion that caused their exile from Ascension. As Baal can
travel at will through time he will have had the opportunity to
do it. Will you:
Thinkstrike the nearest assailant?
Use your blaster?
Try and control one of your assailants?

You twist away from the savage metal blows of his arm and you
can feel the air move on your "face as his blow whips past you.
Lynx reacts with lightning speed. She was trained in unarmed
combat by Yelov, and grabs his arm, using his own impetus to
throw him into the air. He lands well and, rolling to his feet, is
running east towards Culp's Hill before you can act. Turn to 8.

409
You must try to get through the door. You are edging around
the edge of the cavern when you Psychic Awareness tells you
that someone with mental powers has detected your mind.
Then a powerful mind attacks yours. You recognise the mental
power of Baal. Somehow he is the Mother. The attack is
extremely powerful but the piece of the Rack you are holding
pulses, draining his attack of much of its strength. Once again
you are locked in a deadly battle of wills with the cosmic being
known as Baal, Make a Power of Will Roll.

You point the pencil key at the door and it slides open. You jet
into the asteroid. Your battlesuit analyses the air, it will bear
human life, but not for long as it contains toxic substances. You
find yourself in a well lit corridor of polished steel, thirty foot
square, curving away round a corner. The corridor stretches
ahead for what seems like an eternity. Then you can see a darker
patch at its end. You shoot out, to find yourself flying near the
ceiling of an enormous pillared vault. All around you at ceiling
level is a circle of dark niches, their contents indeterminable.
There is an echoing roar of rage and you look down. There,
seated on an enormous throne, cut from a single gigantic
diamond over thirty feet in size is the powerfully muscled form
of Baal. 'Curse you, mortal, will you plague me forever!' he
screams. Then he notices that you are holding the Rack. It is
throbbing with an incredibly bright light, so that it is painful to
look on. For the first time, you see fear on Baal's face. 'No!' he
screams. He tries to hurl a yellow fireball and he tries to exert his
mental power, but he cannot do either. Then he tries to fly up to
you, but he cannot even do that. His face contorts with effort as
he tries to travel in time but to no avail. The Rack is preventing

all his powers from working. Quickly he bellows, 'Kill him!'
From either side of you giant flying creatures burst out of the
small niches, filling the air with a deafening humming. You
recognise the fly-like creatures, similar to the one you fought on
Dustbowl. Will you:
Fire your Particle Disruptor at Baal?
Throw the Rack at Baal?
Try to fight off the fly-like creatures?

Turn to 159

411
Concentrating hard, you project the force of your will into the
mind of the fly being. Its mind is a confusing swirl of alien
thought patterns, so different that it almost unhinges your
mind. However, it seems the creature is under some other kind
of control, nothing like the mental domination you are familiar
with, rather some kind of binding that has been upon the fly
being for centuries beyond reckoning, something which you are
unable to affect. Then its mind invades yours, as its physical
body settles upon you. The combination of the sight of the
enormous insectoid head, a greenish proboscis, dripping saliva
and digestive juices, reeking of decay, descending towards you
and the mental union with a creature whose mind is unutterably
alien, sends you stark raving mad and you are unable to feel as it
slowly sucks your body dry.

412
You split up at the junction wishing each other good luck. You
move on down the centremost tunnel cautiously, your
flamethrower at the ready. You come to the Mining Control
Centre, scanning it carefully. It is deserted. You cross it to the
lift to the mines. You pass your hand over a small beam of light,
and the lift door slides open. You step back, but it is empty. You
walk in and the door closes noiselessly behind you. Disregarding
Bragg's warning in your quest for the final segment of the Rack,
you select the lowest level and the lift begins to drop with gut
wrenching speed, and after a few minutes it comes to a stop.
Turn to 151.

413
You wait until the lights have dimmed and a blanket of silence
has fallen over the Dome, save for the quiet thrum of the
generators. You creep up the corridor. Light seeps out from

around Achov's door. He is still up. As you pass his room you
hear a faint sound, as if of a muffled shriek from far away and a
soft squelching sound. Suppressing your curiosity, you come to
the lab and, opening the door, you glide in silently. You turn on a
lamp and search the lab in the dim light. To your consternation
you cannot find the Rack segment anywhere, but you do find
the egg. It has split open and a thick reddish mucus has spread
from it, dripping onto the floor of the lab with a slow, rhythmic
splatter. You stare at it, fascinated, for several long seconds.
Suddenly there is a sound behind you and you spin to face it. At
the doorway stands Tsu Tsang, looking at you sideways, head
cocked oddly, the light green pinpricks in her eyes. Her posture
is rather stiff and jerky and an eerie shiver goes up your spine.
She seems unnatural in some way. She steps towards you. Make
a Chance Roll.

414
You shake yourself out of your shocked horror. You must
defend yourself as the creature continues to change, the head
crunching in on itself and forming a huge gaping maw where
the shoulders and neck should be, snapping convulsively. Will
you:
Thinkstrike the hideous apparition?
Go for your blaster?

You watch your suit readout for any changes in the Environment Control function, but it remains stable and you arrive at
Falcon's Wing safely. Turn to 100.

416
You see the ship moored at the harbour is the Dustskate. You
walk up the gangplank. A sailor, supposedly on watch, is snoring
loudly, sitting with his back to one of the harpoon guns. The
Dustskate carries two on port and starboard. Gently you wake
him and ask for the captain. Irritably, he points the way to his
cabin and goes back to sleep. Knocking on the door and entering,
you see a burly red-bearded man, going to fat, his feet upon the
desk, talking to another man he calls the Bo'sun. 'What can I do

for you, Offworlder?' he says. You explain to him your
intention to hire Dustskate for a scientific expedition and the
details of your fictitious corporation. He nods, turning to the
Bo'sun he says, These Offworlders are quite mad of course, but
their money is good, eh? Sure we'll take you. 2,000 placs now,
5,000 when we return. Deal?' You pay him the money and he
arranges for your 'diving bell' to be loaded aboard. He introduces
himself as Captain Cresap Ord, and soon the Dustskate is under
way, its great sails unfurled, skudding out across the Sea of
Dust. You notice one or two of the men eyeing you strangely,
and you resolve to be on your guard. You are shown to your
cabin, a functional steel room with one low bunk against the far
wall. Taking no chances, you decide to sleep with your blaster
under the pillow. Turn to 43.

417
You try to twist away, but the shock of seeing Yelov has slowed
your reactions and his clawed hand smashes into your side,
cracking a rib and tumbling you to the ground. Lose 9 Endurance
points. Lynx reacts with lightning speed. She was trained in
unarmed combat by Yelov, and grabs his arm, using his arm's
impetus to throw him through the air. He lands well and, rolling
to his feet, is running east towards Culp's Hill before you can
act. Turn to 8.

Some hours later, you are rested and sitting in Jobanque's office,
relating the story of your mission to your Section Chief. When
you have finished he says: 'A remarkable tale, Falcon. You are
indeed our most resourceful agent. Once again, the Federation indeed all the peoples of the known universe - owe their
freedom to you. Who knows what crimes Baal would have
perpetrated in his lust for ultimate power! The Cavers have had
some unfortunate changes in their past, but they know you

prevented the situation from getting worse. Much worse. The
government of Cave, that is to say, the reigning Mother, has
sent her personal thanks to you. However, not all the news is
good. Agent Lynx is in hospital; she was on Yelov's trail, but he
got the better of her. He's still at large somewhere, but keeping
very quiet. Anyway, go and have some rest now Falcon, you've
earned it!' A few days later, you receive a message asking you to
go and see Jobanque again. When you arrive, you can see
maintenance men going in and out of his office. Going in you
can see it is being cleared out.
Jobanque is standing behind his desk, directing operations.
Seeing you he says, 'Falcon, good to see you.' He pauses for a
moment, smiling at you'. Then he says, 'I've been kicked upstairs,
Falcon. They've selected me to be the Earther Lord of TIME,
along with Silvermane, Pilota and R1llk of the Keladi! I've also
got something for you, Falcon,' and he hands you a sheet of
paper. It is an official TIME document. Your heart leaps as you
realise you have been promoted to Section Chief, taking over
from Jobanque's position. 'Agents Bloodhound, Lynx, Leopard,
Chameleon and the rest are all under your command now,
Falcon,' Jobanque says happily. 'Congratulations, Section Chief!
Before you go, I've one last surprise for you,' and he opens the
door. Standing there, grinning, is Braxton Bragg, looking a little
older, but much the same, preserved by life-prolonging drugs.
He smiles warmly and grabs your hand, shaking it vigorously.
'Good to see you again, after all these years. Falcon. Jobanque
has told me all about it. I've always wondered who you were, a
Time Traveller, eh! Never would've guessed it back on Chill in a
million years.' You leave the TIME building together. He tells
you he owns the Mining Company now and you reminisce
about what he calls the 'Old Days' together, That thing
certainly gave us a hard time, eh, Falcon.' But, of course, for him
it was fifty-eight years ago, whilst for you it has only been a
matter of days....
