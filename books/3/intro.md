# EARTH 3033 AD
A third of the land's surface is populated with cities which
stretch miles up towards the Ionosphere and are also tunnelled
deep into the Earth's crust.
The world is united - war within the atmosphere of a single
planet can only lead to total destruction. Government is carried
out by Executives, each having full powers within a certain area.
The Food, Health, Pleasure and Enforcement Executives are
centred in Alpolis, a city covering what was once an independent
country - Switzerland - and it is here that the most recent
Executive, TIME, exists.
People live for fun, not to work. Most tasks are performed by
robots, so life is quite easy. Only 10% of the population still
works, and then only for fun or out of a sense of social duty.
Food is plentiful, the main source being a fungus grown in huge
vats under artificial light. Luxury foods, such as meat, are a
rarity. Communications have improved so as to transform
society: holophones connect all homes across the Space
Federation so it is possible to be in direct contact with many alien
species light years across space. Travel on Earth is done by
hovrail, jetcopter or stratocruiser, so that the longest journey
need take no more than an hour.

The average Earther lives for two hundred and fifty years and
the ageing process only begins during the last fifty years of life.
Life-prolonging drugs, called Anagathics, are freely available,
and transplant surgery is now a simple operation. Unfortunately, because people live longer, there are many problems.
There is overcrowding and very little to do which has resulted in
a rapid increase in violent crime. With so many people needing
new hearts, lungs and other organs there is a shortage of spare
parts for use in transplant surgery, so the Enforcement
Executive has passed a Termination Code. All violent crimes are
punishable by painless death. The Enforcement Executive has
had sensors set up to catch criminals, especially Bodybrokers
who deal illegally in organs for surgery. If Energy Weapons are
used by criminals, for instance, a police jetcopter will be there in
seconds.

Earth, using Hyperdrive, faster-than-light travel, has established itself as head of the Space Federation, which includes all the
Earth colonies and alien planets. The Navy patrols the colonies:
Lastlanding, Proxima Centauri, Ascension and so on, as well as
the alien worlds: Kelados, Sundew, Dyskra, Clyss, Rigel Prime,
the Hive and others. Contact with alien life forms is
commonplace and the colony ships of the twenty-fourth
century are still approaching the centre of the galaxy.
How to Travel in Time
Travel through time involves crossing a fourth dimension,
'Null-space' or the 'Void' as it is known. This dimension joins all
points in time and space from the beginning of the universe to
its end. Imagine time as a cable. Earth's Timeline (or past,
present and future) is a single strand of this cable 'stretching
from Earth's beginning to the end of time. The Timelines of
other planets run alongside this and weave around each other,
because events on one planet affect things on another. These
strands, or Timelines, are insulated from the fourth dimension
in the same way that an electrical wire is insulated. At certain
points there are holes in the insulation allowing travel from one
point on the wire through this hole to a different point on this or
another wire. In this way a Time Machine may move from one
'Timehole' to another and from one point in space to another via
Null-space.

The Timeholes are formed when the fabric of time is damaged
by unknown forces. They can be larger, but are usually less than
five miles across. Timeholes come and go as new damage occurs
and older Timeholes close up naturally. The Monitoring Section
is responsible for keeping the map of current Timeholes. Your
up-to-date map is at the beginning of the book. At least one hole
has been there for a long time - the Eiger Vault, near the TIME
Building in the Alps. It is thought to be a permanent Timehole
and your Time Machine, Falcon's Wing, is kept there along with
those of the Lords of TIME and other Agents. Some Timeholes
are safer than others and it is possible to go back in time only to
find that the hole through which you travelled has closed up,
trapping the unfortunate traveller in the past. Time passes at
the same rate in all Timeholes as on Earth. If you begin a journey
to a Timehole ten minutes after somebody else does you will
arrive ten minutes later than them. Only those with Psychic
Awareness can navigate across Null-space.

# Game Rules

# ATTACK

In certain paragraphs you will have the chance to attack an
enemy. When you choose to do so, you will be asked to make an
Attack Roll. To do this, roll two dice and add the numbers
together. You will be told which paragraph to turn to next,
depending on your score. In all combats you are more likely to
succeed if your score is high than if it is low.

# ATTACK MODIFIER

Whenever you make an Attack Roll you must add or subtract
your Attack Modifier to the dice score. Your Attack Modifier
may change as the adventure unfolds and you should keep a
note of this on your Agent Profile (at the beginning of the
adventure). To begin with your Attack Modifier is zero.

# EVASION

In certain cases you may need to avoid the attack of an enemy or
escape from a difficult situation. You will be asked to make an
Evasion Roll, to which you must add or subtract your Evasion
Modifier. This works in the same way as the Attack Roll and
Attack Modifier as described above. Your initial Evasion
Modifier is also zero. CHANCE
There are moments in any agent's career when pure luck will
play its part. On such occasions you will be asked to make a
Chance Roll. Roll one die. You will then be instructed to turn to
a new paragraph.

# POWERS OF THE MIND

Some paragraphs will offer you the chance to make a mental
attack, either a Thinkstrike or Power of Will. Make an Attack
Roll, just as if you were attacking normally, but add or subtract
your Thinkstrike or Power of Will Modifier, not your Attack
Modifier. In all other ways mental attacks work in the same way
as a physical attack. To begin with your Thinkstrike and Power
of Will Modifiers are zero, as noted on your Agent Profile.

# PSYCHIC AWARENESS

Your Psychic Awareness operates at all times and you will be
told when you have discovered anything of interest.

# ENDURANCE

You, Falcon, start the adventure with 20 points of Endurance. If
you are wounded in combat, suffer something unpleasant such
as an acid atmosphere without a space suit, or become
exhausted, you will lose Endurance points. A running total of
your Endurance should be kept on your Agent Profile. If at any
time you fall to zero Endurance or less you are dead and your
adventure is over. Endurance points can be regained by visiting
the Autodoc in your Time Machine (see equipment list) and you
will be told when you can use your Autodoc.

# SCORING
You will notice as you use this book that certain paragraph
numbers are followed by a letter in brackets. If you wish to score
your performance as Special Agent Falcon, you will need to
make a list of the letters following these numbers on the box
provided on your Agent Profile every time you come to one of
these paragraphs. If you should be killed or fail in your
adventure, you should delete your current recorded letters except
for all the Qs which must be kept and begin again. Each letter
corresponds to a score, and you will be given a rating, depending
on what the total of your scores is. The letter scores may be
found at the back of the fourth book of this series, Lost in Time.
This is necessary, since printing the scores in this book would
allow you to find out what the right decisions to take in this
adventure are!

# Special Rules
. The action in Falcon 3: The Rack of Baal, carries straight on from
Falcon 2: Mechanon. If you have played Falcon 2, transfer the
modifier scores from your Agent Profile in the beginning of this
one. It is not essential to play Falcon 1 and 2 first, but information
you may gain while playing them may help you to complete this
mission successfully. If you have not played Falcon 1 or 2, then all
of your modifiers begin at zero.
Starship Trooper Battlesuit
During Falcon Book 3, you may be issued with a standard issue
battlesuit. It has 10 Defence points. When you take damage in the
battlesuit you will be told to lose a certain number of points.
Simply cross off the relevant amount in the box provided on
your Agent Profile.

# STRIKE FIGHTER

# Equipment
Standard Issue for TIME Special Agents

# ITEM 1: MODEL A3 TIME MACHINE [see accompanying specifications]
Your own Time Machine, Falcon's Wing, is silver with bright
scarlet markings and is the eleventh machine capable of travel
through time ever built. Its cost cannot be computed, since it
involves the use of certain materials and scientific skills which
are priceless. The silver and scarlet hull will withstand
enormous pressure, heat and exposure to harmful gases and
liquids, as well as providing protection from radiation.
The six hydraulic legs which support the machine are extended
when it materialises in a new Timehole, to provide stability on
uneven ground. The Main Access is operated by invisible
Tractor Beams (energy beams that can be used to grip and lift)
that will draw the Time Traveller up into the cabin, to rest on
the Access Disc. This disc is matter but is changed to air as you
move through it by the Molecular Convertor (see Item 4). The
pressurised cabin is lined with instruments and gadgets. The
crash couch is moulded to fit your shape and can be moved up to
the command console or up into the Flyer (see Item 6).
The air inside the machine is kept pure by the life support unit
and can be flushed out and replaced within ten seconds. The
Main Access will work only when its Memory Scanner
recognises your own brain patterns. Specially sensitive cameras
and power floodlights are mounted on top of the Machine. The
Variac Drive, which forces the Machine into null-space, is
housed beneath the deck and is controlled through your
computer (CAIN, see Item 7).

# ITEM 2: HOLOGRAM GENERATOR

Each Time Machine is equipped with a Hologram Generator very important if the First Law of TIME is to be obeyed. The
Generator changes the appearance of the Machine by casting a
hologram around it, so the computer can make the Machine
look like a small wood, hayrick or grassy hill etc, which is very
lifelike unless you are within two metres of the Machine itself.
This stops people in history being curious at the sight of a highly
technological machine.

# ITEM 3: HOLO-DETECTOR

Due to the existence of Hologram Generators you may find it
difficult to see other Time Machines. As a member of the Time
Police you have been given a Hologram-detector which is
portable and operates to a range of fifty metres. This will reveal
the presence of a hologram and therefore another Time
Machine.

# ITEM 4: MOLECULAR CONVERTOR

Each Time Machine is equipped with a Molecular Convertor, a
device which uses the rarest of all elements, Polybdenum, as its
fuel. Small articles, placed in the Convertor, are transformed
into whatever the computer decides. In this way, Time
Travellers have disguises which allow them to pass undetected
amongst the intelligent beings of other times. CAIN, your
computer, carries information about the Timeholes shown on
your map, so that the blueprints required by the Convertor to
make the disguises accurate are usually available. Your Psionic
Helmet, for instance, can be turned into a legionary's helmet,
while keeping its modern powers.
ITEM 5: AUTODOC [see accompanying specifications]
This is a couch-like device which has needles, a drip, a blood
supply and surgical robo-arms. You may lie in the Autodoc
during the time taken to travel from one Timehole to another,
for instance, and come out healed, restoring your Endurance by
up to twelve points. You will be told when you can use your
Autodoc.

# ITEM 6: FLYER [see accompanying specifications)
Your crash-couch swivels up onto the platform of your flyer
when you wish to use it. The flyer is a small hover raft which is
catapulted out of the Time Machine through the Launch Doors,
two sections on top of the hull that slide apart. Once safely away


# ITEM 7: CAIN [Cybernetic Artificial Intelligence Nexus]
CAIN is one of the most advanced computers known to man. Its
data banks offer information on all subjects and historical data
on all Federation and alien planets. Its memory banks are
continuously updated with information concerning the Timeholes and it is able to link with the massive memory banks of the
TIME Service Computer at the Eiger Vault. A Holophone,
through which you can contact any other Holophone in the
Federation, is built into CAIN and you also have access to most
of the files kept by TIME. CAIN answers to your spoken
commands and runs the Time Machine for you. It can display
information visually, via the terminal screen, or verbally, using
its melodic chimes.

# ITEM 8: BLASTER [see accompanying specifications]
This is your Standard Starship Trooper issue Plasma Pistol. It
fires superheated plasma to a range of 100 metres, and the
Energy Pack is sufficient for ten minutes continuous use. You
have more Energy Packs in your weapons locker. Your blaster is
labelled, 'For use in exceptional circumstances only'.

# ITEM 9: PSIONIC ENHANCER [see accompanying specifications]
This helmet helps your Powers of the Mind by damping all other
thoughts. It senses when you want to use your power and
activates automatically.

# ITEM 10: ENVIRONMENT SUIT [see accompanying specifications]
A light, pressurised suit for use in vacuum, inhospitable
atmospheres and extreme ranges of temperature which
monitors your life signals such as pulse and temperature. It is
compatible with your Psionic Enhancer.

# Personal Background

SpecialAgent(TIME)
from the Machine the Ion Drive can be cut in, giving the flyer a
top speed many times the speed of sound (Mach 6). It can hover
which allows you to use it as an observation platform, but it is
too small to carry a Hologram Generator and should only be
used when strictly necessary. Fortunately, its Ion Drive is
almost soundless. You are also issued with a Homing Beacon,
which, when activated, will make the flyer move to its location
as quickly as possible. The flyer is then piloted by its micro
computer. The Beacon is magnetic, and about the size of a die.

Codename: Falcon
For three years you have studied at the Academy as a cadet
attached to TIME: the Temporal, Investigative and Monitoring
Executive, and you have passed the difficult training programme with flying colours. You have been selected from the
Academy to be a Special Agent because of your unusual talents,
having been born with Powers of the Mind: you can sense
things that others can't and even influence their actions
through thought alone. These powers have been strengthened

ENVIRONMENT SUIT

and focussed during your training and you have been issued
with a Psionic Enhancer, a helmet which increases these mental
powers. You have been taught to attack the minds of others
with a blast of mental energy you call Thinkstrike. Your Power
of Will allows you to control the minds of those weaker than
you, and your Psychic Awareness allows you to sense things
that others cannot, including the presence of another with such
mental powers. This Psychic Awareness also lets you navigate
your Time Machine through time and space. Few have such
powers and even fewer are trusted with one of the small
number of Time Machines in existence.
You are expert in survival - including combat - armed and
unarmed. History and detective powers of deduction have also
been major subjects of study. You are now an Agent in the Time
Police, whose job is to guard the Timelines of the past and to
ensure that no one tampers with past events in any way that
would change things as they are now.
TIME, the Temporal Investigative and Monitoring Executive,
was set up in Alpolis forty years ago shortly after Time Travel
was discovered. The realisation that anyone with access to Time
Travel could change the past so that the entire human race
might cease to exist was worrying, so Time Machines were built
for the Time Police in their crystal domed TIME headquarters,
in order to stop this. TIME is headed by five Lords, representing
the most powerful groups in the Space Federation. Each of these
has Powers of the Mind, and their own Time Machine.
The Executive is divided into four sections: Administrative,
Research, Monitoring and the Special Agent Section (or SAS).
The Monitoring Section, headed by Section Chief Jobanque, is
responsible for noting any disturbances in the past, or
Timelines, of the planets in the Federation. The Research
Section, headed by Section Chief Skirrow, is responsible for all
equipment used by Special Agents and is also examining the
possibilities of travel into the future, as yet impossible. Your
own Special Agent Section is headed by Section Chief Agidy
Yelov, a Siriun humanoid from the Federation member planet,
Sirius Secundus. Agidy Yelov and others have told you the
importance of the First Law of TIME when on active service:'A
TIME Agent must, in all cases, act naturally according to the
time in which he is currently operating, thus minimising any

disruption of the Timelines his or her presence might be
causing'. As Yelov once said to you: There's no point in coming
back to 3033 if you have left an atomic hand gun near Hitler's
bunker, because this would change the present - in fact, you'd
probably find you had never existed!' As with all Special Agents,
your bloodline has been traced back, in your case to the French
Revolution in 1789 AD. Should any one of your ancestors fail to
produce the next in line it would be as if you had never existed.
Hints on Play
The rules are very simple - you could almost play this book
without reading them at all. But reading the Personal
Background and, of course, the Mission Brief will help you to
understand what is happening as you begin the adventure. If
you come cross something you don't understand, don't worry,
check the Equipment List and this may give you a clue. If not,
carry- on anyway, it will probably come clear later.
A Brief Historical Update
In Falcon 1: The Renegade Lord, you, as Falcon, after a desperate
chase across time, thwarted the evil plans of the renegade Lord
of TIME. Falcon also discovered that the then Section Chief of
the Special Agents, Agidy Yelov, was in league with the
Renegade Lord and was a traitor. Falcon killed the Renegade
Lord and captured Yelov. Jobanque was given Yelov's old post.
In Falcon 2: Mechanon, Yelov escaped and swore revenge against
Falcon and the Federation. Using the massed wardroids of the
factory planet, Mechanon, Yelov planned to conquer the galaxy.
But Falcon penetrated Mechanon and killed Yelov in a titanic
battle. However, Yelov's last act was to set into motion a series
of events that would completely destroy Earth. The only way
Falcon could save Earth from annihilation was by changing the
past, thus creating a paradox in time in which prior events never
took place. The Earth was saved, but Yelov was alive and still at
large - Falcon never killed him. This is where the action begins in
Falcon 3: The Rack of Baal.
Mission Brief
Once again you are sitting in the office of your Section Chief,
Jobanque, after an urgent summons. He eyes you, his face
serious. 'Well Falcon, I've sent Lynx out to trail Yelov. There's
something even more urgent for you. Baal has escaped.'

'Who?'you query, puzzled.
'Let me explain,' and he presses a button and a hologram of a
globe of crackling white energy appears, hanging in the
darkness of interstellar space. Orbiting it is a small asteroid.
That ball of rock is a satellite, put there by the Ancients.' You sit
up in interest. Archaelogical remains of a highly advanced
culture, thousands upon thousands of years old, are dotted
everywhere around the galaxy, popularly referred to as remains
of the Ancient Culture. 'A Federation research station was set
up on the satellite - the Federation is always hoping to uncover
some of the Ancient's advanced technology. A group of psychics
was brought in to probe the globe of energy, rather than fiddle
with it in any other way. Immediately they did so their minds fell
under the control of some powerful will from inside the globe. It
forced the psychics to board a Federation starship and fly it
straight at the globe. The resultant explosion weakened the
globe enough for the thing inside it to break out,' and Jobanque
presses another button. The hologram of the globe bursts open
in a veritable holocaust of flaming energy. A great figure,
human in shape, powerfully muscled, a strange white triangle at
wrists and ankles erupts forth, a look of crazed triumph on its
face. That is Baal,' says Jobanque, and he freezes the hologram.
'We discovered an Ancient Codex on the satellite and a team of
scientists, working night and day, have managed to decipher it.
It told us a lot. Baal is a cosmic being, aeons old. Some would call
him a god. He is utterly evil, totally unscrupulous. Power-crazed
he sought, and will seek again, to dominate all intelligent life in
the galaxy. He feeds off the life forces of sentient beings and is
sustained by some kind of natural energy. Our scientists think
he is linked to the very fabric of the universe in some way, at any
rate not even the Ancients were able to destroy him outright,
although they managed to imprison him. Baal can travel in time
at will, without having to use timeholes. That means he can go
anywhere in the past he wishes and he can exist in any
environment. The Ancients built something they called the
Rack to imprison him - it is composed of those four triangular
objects at his wrists and ankles. Apparently, each piece of the
Rack inhibits Baal's powers, cumulatively, if they are near to
him. With the Rack momentarily deactivated, Baal was able to
remove the pieces, and has scattered each segment throughout
space and time. Your mission, Falcon, is to find each piece, unite
them and then imprison Baal once more. A difficult mission, but

# AGENT PROFILE:

the fate of the galaxy is at stake; there's no telling what damage a
being like that could do to the timelines.'
'But how will I be able to locate the Rack, if it isn't to be found at a
timehole?' you ask.
'Don't worry, it won't be as hard as it seems to find them. It is
likely that objects of such power will cause timeholes to appear
around them, as will Baal if he stays in one place for any length
of time. Also, we have this/ and he hands you a small metal
tripod with a large glowing white gem at its tip. This is an
Ancient device that will detect the sections of the Rack, but only
somebody with psychic powers can interpret its signals. Your
only chance is to conduct a random search through the
timeholes until you find the pieces. A final warning, Falcon. As
Baal can travel freely in time, he has had plenty of opportunity
to set up all sorts of things to prevent the Rack from being
discovered. In effect, sections of the Rack will have been lying in
places for centuries now. Lastly you will not, of course, be able
to take the Strike Fighter with you - using it on this mission
would almost certainly break the first law of TIME. Right,
Falcon, that's it. Get going and good luck.' Turn to 1.
