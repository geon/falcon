A third of the land's surface is populated with cities which
stretch miles up towards the Ionosphere and are also tunnelled
deep into the Earth's crust.
The world is united - war within the atmosphere of a single
planet can only lead to total destruction. Government is carried
out by Executives, each having full powers within a certain area.
The Food, Health, Pleasure and Enforcement Executives are
centred in Alpolis, a city covering what was once an independent
country - Switzerland - and it is here that the most recent
Executive, TIME, exists.
People live for fun, not to work. Most tasks are performed by
robots, so life is quite easy. Only 10% of the population still
works, and then only for fun or out of a sense of social duty.
Food is plentiful, the main source being a fungus grown in huge
vats under artificial light. Luxury foods, such as meat, are a
rarity. Communications have improved so as to transform
society: holophones connect all homes across the Space
Federation so it is possible to be in direct contact with many alien
species light years across space. Travel on Earth is done by
hovrail, jetcopter or stratocruiser, so that the longest journey
need take no more than an hour.
The average Earther lives for two hundred and fifty years and
the ageing process only begins during the last fifty years of life.
Life-prolonging drugs, called Anagathics, are freely available,
and transplant surgery is now a simple operation. Unfortunately, because people live longer, there are many
problems. There is overcrowding and very little to do which has
resulted in a rapid increase in violent crime. With so many
people needing new hearts, lungs and other organs there is a
shortage of spare parts for use in transplant surgery, so the
Enforcement Executive has passed a Termination Code. All
violent crimes are punishable by painless death. The Enforcement Executive has had sensors set up to catch criminals,
especially Bodybrokers who deal illegally in organs for surgery.
If Energy Weapons are used by criminals, for instance, a police
jetcopter will be there in seconds.
Earth, using Hyperdrive, faster-than-light travel, has estab-

lished itself as head of the Space Federation, which includes all
the earth colonies and alien planets. The Navy patrols the
colonies: Lastlanding, Proxima Centauri, Ascension and so on
as well as the alien worlds: Kelados, Sundew, Dyskra, Clyss
Rigel Prime, the Hive and others. Contact with alien life forms is
commonplace and the colony ships of the twenty-fourth
century are still approaching the centre of the galaxy.
How to Travel in Time
Travel through time involves crossing a fourth dimension/nullspace or the 'Void' as it is known. This dimension joins all points
in time and space from the beginning of the universe to its end
Imagine time as a cable. Earth's Timeline (or past, present and
future) is a single strand of this cable stretching from Earth's
beginning to the end of time. The Timelines of other planets run
alongside this and weave around each other, because events on
one planet affect things on another. These strands, or
Timelines, are insulated from the fourth dimension in the same
way that an electrical wire is insulated. At certain points there
are holes in the insulation allowing travel from one point on the
wire through this hole to a different point on this or another
wire. In this way a Time Machine may move from one 'timehole'
to another and from one point in space to another via null-space.
The timeholes are formed when the fabric of time is damaged by
unknown forces. They can be larger, but are usually less than
five miles across. Timeholes come and go as new damage occurs
and older timeholes close up naturally. The Monitoring Section
is responsible for keeping the map of current timeholes. At least
one hole has been there for a long time - the Eiger Vault, near
he TIME building in the Alps. It is thought to be a permanent
timehole and your Time Machine, Falcon's Wing, is kept there
along with those of the Lords of TIME and other Agents. Some
timeholes are safer than others and it is possible to go back in
time only to find that the hole through which you travelled has
closed up, trapping the unfortunate traveller in the past Time
passes at the same rate in all timeholes as on Earth. If you begin a
journey to a timehole ten minutes after somebody else does you
will arrive ten minutes later than them. Only those with Psychic
Awareness can navigate across null-space.
ATTACK

Game Rules

In certain paragraphs you will have the chance to attack an

enemy. When you choose to do so, you will be asked to make an
Attack Roll. To do this, roll two dice and add the numbers
together. You will be told which paragraph to turn to next,
depending on your score. In all combats you are more likely to
succeed if your score is high than if it is low.
ATTACK MODIFIER

Whenever you make an Attack Roll you must add or subtract
your Attack Modifier to the dice score. Your Attack Modifier
may change as the adventure unfolds and you should keep a
note of this on your Agent Profile (see end of this introduction).
To begin with your Attack Modifier is zero.
EVASION
In certain cases you may need to avoid the attack of an enemy or
escape from a difficult situation. You will be asked to make an
Evasion Roll, to which you must add or subtract your Evasion
Modifier. This works in the same way as the Attack Roll and
Attack Modifier as described above. Your initial Evasion
Modifier is also zero.
CHANCE
There are moments in any agent's career when pure luck will
play its part. On such occasions you will be asked to make a
Chance Roll. Roll one die. You will then be instructed to turn to
a new paragraph.
POWERS OF THE MIND

Some paragraphs will offer you the chance to make a mental
attack, either a Thinkstrike or Power of Will. Make an Attack
Roll, just as if you were attacking normally, but add or subtract
your Thinkstrike or Power of Will Modifier, not your Attack
Modifier. In all other ways mental attacks work in the same way
as a physical attack. To begin with your Thinkstrike and Power
of Will Modifiers are zero, as noted on your Agent Profile.
PSYCHIC AWARENESS

Your Psychic Awareness operates at all times and you will be
told when you have discovered anything of interest.
ENDURANCE

You, Falcon, start the adventure with 20 points of Endurance. If
you are wounded in combat, suffer something unpleasant such
as an acid atmosphere without a space suit, or become

exhausted, you will lose Endurance points. A running total of
your Endurance should be kept on your Agent Profile. If at any
time you fall to zero Endurance or less you are dead and your
adventure is over. Endurance points can be regained by visiting
the Autodoc in your Time Machine (see equipment list) and you
will be told when you can use your Autodoc.
Equipment
Standard Issue for TIME Special Agents
ITEM 1: MODEL A3 TIME MACHINE [see accompanying specifications]
Your own Time Machine, Falcon's Wing, is silver with bright
scarlet markings and is the eleventh machine capable of travel
through time ever built. Its cost cannot be computed, since it
involves the use of certain materials and scientific skills which
are priceless. The silver and scarlet hull will withstand
enormous pressure, heat and exposure to harmful gases and
liquids, as well as providing protection from radiation.
The six hydraulic legs which support the machine are extended
when it materialises in a new Timehole, to provide stability on
uneven ground. The Main Access is operated by invisible
Tractor Beams (energy beams that can be used to grip and lift)
that will draw the Time Traveller up into the cabin, to rest on
the Access Disc. This disc is matter but is changed to air as you
move through it by the Molecular Convertor (see Item 4). The
pressurised cabin is lined with instruments and gadgets. The
crash-couch is moulded to fit your shape and can be moved up to
the command console or up into the Flyer (see Item 6).
The air inside the machine is kept pure by the life support unit
and can be flushed out and replaced within ten seconds. The
Main Access will work only when its Memory Scanner
recognises your own brain patterns. Specially sensitive cameras
and power floodlights are mounted on top of the Machine. The
Variac Drive, which forces the Machine into null-space, is
housed beneath the deck and is controlled through your
computer (CAIN, see Item 7).
ITEM 2: HOLOGRAM GENERATOR

Each Time Machine is equipped with a Hologram Generator very important if the First Law of TIME is to be obeyed. The
Generator changes the appearance of the Machine by casting a
hologram around it, so the computer can make the Machine

look like a small wood, hayrick or grassy hill etc, which is very
lifelike unless you are within two metres of the Machine itself.
This stops people in history being curious at the sight of a highly
technological machine.

almost soundless. You are also issued with a Homing Beacon,
which, when activated, will make the flyer move to its location
as quickly as possible. The flyer is then piloted by its micro
computer. The Beacon is magnetic, and about the size of a die.

ITEM 3: HOLO-DETECTOR

ITEM 7: CAIN [Cybernetic Artificial Intelligence Nexus]
CAIN is one of the most advanced computers known to man. Its
data banks offer information on all subjects and historical data
on all Federation and alien planets. Its memory banks are
continuously updated with information concerning the Timeholes and it is able to link with the massive memory banks of the
TIME Service Computer at the Eiger Vault. A Holophone,
through which you can contact any other Holophone in the
Federation, is built into CAIN and you also have access to most
of the files kept by TIME. CAIN answers to your spoken
commands and runs the Time Machine for you. It can display
information visually, via the terminal screen, or verbally, using
its melodic chimes.

Due to the existence of Hologram Generators you may find it
difficult to see other Time Machines. As a member of the Time
Police you have been given a Hologram-detector which is
portable and operates to a range of fifty metres. This will reveal
the presence of a hologram and therefore another Time
Machine.
ITEM 4: MOLECULAR CONVERTOR

Each Time Machine is equipped with a Molecular Convertor, a
device which uses the rarest of all elements, Polybdenum, as its
fuel. Small articles, placed in the Convertor, are transformed
into whatever the computer decides. In this way, Time
Travellers have disguises which allow them to pass undetected
amongst the intelligent beings of other times. CAIN, your
computer, carries information about the Timeholes shown on
your map, so that the blueprints required by the Convertor to
make the disguises accurate, are usually available. Your Psionic
Helmet, for instance, can be turned into a legionary's helmet,
while keeping its modern powers.
ITEM 5: AUTODOC [see accompanying specifications]
This is a couch-like device which has needles, a drip, a blood
supply and surgical robo-arms. You may lie in the Autodoc
during the time taken to travel from one Timehole to another,
for instance, and come out healed, restoring your Endurance by
up to twelve points. You will be told when you can use your
Autodoc.
ITEM 6: FLYER [see accompanying specification]
Your crash-couch swivels up onto the platform of your flyer
when you wish to use it. The flyer is a small hover raft which is
catapulted out of the Time Machine through the Launch Doors,
two sections on top of the hull that slide apart. Once safely a way
from the Machine the Ion Drive can be cut in, giving the flyer a
top speed many times the speed of sound (Mach 6). It can hover
which allows you to use it as an observation platform, but it is
too small to carry a Hologram Generator and should only be
used when strictly necessary. Fortunately, its Ion Drive is

ITEM 8: BLASTER [see accompanying specifications]
This is your Standard Starship Trooper issue Plasma Pistol. It
fires superheated plasma to a range of 100 metres, and the
Energy Pack is sufficient for ten minutes' continuous use. You
have more Energy Packs in your weapons locker. Your blaster is
labelled, 'For use in exceptional circumstances only'.
ITEM 9: PSIONIC ENHANCER [see accompanying specifications]
This helmet helps your Powers of the Mind by damping all other
thoughts. It senses when you want to use your power and
activates automatically.
ITEM 10: ENVIRONMENT SUIT [see accompanying specifications]
A light, pressurised suit for use in vacuum, inhospitable
atmospheres and extreme ranges of temperature which
monitors your life signals such as pulse and temperature. It is
compatible with your Psionic Enhancer.
Personal Background
Special Agent (TIME)
Codename: Falcon
For three years you have studied at the Academy as a cadet
attached to TIME: the Temporal, Investigative and Monitoring
Executive, and you have passed the difficult training programme with flying colours. You have been selected from the

Academy to be a Special Agent because of your unusual talents,
having been born with Powers of the Mind: you can sense
things that others can't and even influence their actions
through thought alone. These powers have been strengthened
and focused during your training and you have been issued with
a Psionic Enhancer, a helmet which increases these mental
powers. You have been taught to attack the minds of others
with a blast of mental energy you call Thinkstrike. Your Power
of Will allows you to control the minds of those weaker than
you, and your Psychic Awareness allows you to sense things
that others cannot, including the presence of another with such
mental powers. This Psychic Awareness also lets you navigate
your Time Machine through time and space. Few have such
powers and even fewer are trusted with one of the small
number of Time Machines in existence.
You are expert in survival - including combat - armed and
unarmed. History and detective powers of deduction have also
been major subjects of study. You are now an Agent in the Time
Police, whose job is to guard the Timelines of the past and to
ensure that no one tampers with past events in any way that
would change things as they are now.
TIME, the Temporal Investigative and Monitoring Executive,
was set up in Alpolis forty years ago shortly after Time Travel
was discovered. The realisation that anyone with access to Time
Travel could change the past so that the entire human race
might cease to exist was worrying, so Time Machines were built
for the Time Police in their crystal domed TIME headquarters,
in order to stop this. TIME is headed by five Lords, representing
the most powerful groups in the Space Federation. Each of these
has Powers of the Mind, and their own Time Machine.
The Executive is divided into four sections: Administrative,
Research, Monitoring and the Special Agent Section (or SAS).
The Monitoring Section, headed by Section Chief Jobanque, is
responsible for noting any disturbances in the past, or
Timelines, of the planets in the Federation. The Research
Section, headed by Section Chief Skirrow, is responsible for all
equipment used by Special Agents and is also examining the
possibilities of travel into the future, as yet impossible. Your
own Special Agent Section is headed by Section Chief Agidy
Yelov, a Siriun humanoid from the Federation member planet,
Sirius Secundus. Agidy Yelov and others have told you the

importance of the First Law of TIME when on active service: 'A
TIME Agent must, in all cases, act naturally according to the
time in which he is currently operating, thus minimising any
disruption of the Timelines his or her presence might be
causing'. As Yelov once said to you: 'There's no point in coming
back to 3033 AD if you have left an atomic hand gun near
Hitler's bunker, because this would change the present - in fact,
you'd probably find you had never existed!' As with all Special
Agents, your bloodline has been traced back, in your case to the
French Revolution in 1789 AD. Should any one of your
ancestors fail to produce the next in line it would be as if you had
never existed.
The rules are very simple - you could almost play this book
without reading them at all. But reading the Personal
Background and, of course, the Mission Brief will help you to
understand what is happening as you begin the adventure. If
you come across something you don't understand, don't worry,
check the Equipment List and this may give you a clue. If not,
carry on anyway, it will probably become clear later.
A Brief Historical Update
In Book 1: The Renegade Lord, you, as Falcon, after a desperate chase
across time thwarted the evil plans of the renegade Lord of
TIME. Falcon also discovered that the then Section Chief of the
Special Agents, Agidy Yelov, was in league with the Renegade
Lord and was a traitor. Falcon killed the Renegade Lord and
captured Yelov. Jobanque was given Yelov's old post.
In Book 2: Mechanon Yelov escaped and swore revenge against
Falcon and the Federation. Using the massed wardroids of the
factory planet, Mechanon, Yelov planned to conquer the galaxy.
But Falcon penetrated Mechanon and killed Yelov in a titanic
battle. However, Yelov's last act was to set into motion a series
of events that would completely destroy Earth. The only way
Falcon could save Earth from annihilation was by changing the
past, thus creating a paradox in time in which prior events never
took place. The Earth was saved, but Yelov was alive and still at
large - Falcon never killed him.
In Book 3: The Rack of Baal Baal, a cosmic supervillain with god-like
powers escaped from his bonds (the Rack) imposed upon him by
an ancient civilisation aeons ago. Falcon tracked down the Rack

of Baal, that had been scattered across time and space and was
able to imprison the super powerful being known as Baal - just.
For this and prior services Falcon was promoted to Section
Chief, Jobanque's old position. He in turn was made a TIME
Lord. However, Yelov was still at large ...

his hands and shrugs. 'There are three graduates who have
recently passed out of the Academy, none is ideal, but they are a
talented group. You may recruit one as Bloodhound's replacement. They will be in your office, ready for you to interview, at
noon today.

In Book 4: Lost in Time Skirrow of the Research Section had come
up with a way of travelling into the future - never before
attempted successfully. Falcon volunteered. A future trip was
made but in attempting to return home Falcon was hopelessly
lost amid the myriad timeholes of the space time continuum,
cast adrift on the winds of time. After many strange adventures
Falcon was able to activate a Stasis Field, thousands of years in
the past, and wait, frozen in time, until the 31st century. Upon
returning, Falcon was given a holiday on the pleasure dome of
Titan - but not for long. Yelov has been seen once more, this
time with powerful allies ...

'One of our moles in CYBERNET tells us that Yelov has made
contact with the criminal underworld on the exile-planet,
Barbarossa. He has recruited three of their most dangerous
operatives, the Thaccoid, Dark Star and the Symbiont. I suggest
you examine the Enforcement Executive files on them before
you select your new agent. Yelov is planning to use them in
some insane scheme, but we don't know what yet - perhaps to
kill you. Agent Leopard is on Barbarossa at the moment; you
may recall him if you wish. The files on the Academy graduates
are available now, I suggest you study them right away. That's
all. Falcon. Good hunting.'

Mission Brief
Rested and revitalised after experiencing the exotic delights of
the pleasure dome on Titan, Jobanque's summons to join him in
his office for your next mission briefing sends a tingle of
excitement through you.

Turn to 1.

Jobanque's smile, as welcoming as ever, matches the twinkle in
his eye as he enquires after your welfare. Your ordeal following
the attempt at future travel which lost you in time left you tense
and fatigued at your last meeting, but you are able to assure the
Lord of TIME that you have regained your enthusiasm for the
job. He laughs out loud when you ask, in mock apprehension,
whether Section Chief Skirrow of the Technical Section has any
new inventions for you to try - it was his addition to the Variac
Drive of Falcon's Wing that sent you into a parallel universe in
Jobanque soon becomes serious: 'I expect you'll enjoy this
mission, Falcon. Search and Destroy. Your target is your mortal
enemy, Yelov. Find him and kill him. We cannot afford to allow
him to live. You may use all available agents as long as someone
is delegated to police the timelines. Lynx is still out, recuperating
after her last brush with Yelov, and Bloodhound has
disappeared unaccountably. We simply cannot trace him, we've
tried everything - he could be anywhere in time and space ...
