<p>The door hums closed behind you as you step out of the high security wing which houses Section Chief Yelov's offices. Boarding the pedway you request the time. The Service Computer responds from a nearby speaker: 'It is three minutes, fifteen seconds to your appointment with the Lords of TIME at 10am, Falcon. If you would care to step into Lane 9, I can see that you arrive in time.' Realising that you have only a few moments to prepare, you transfer to Lane 9 and open a link to CAIN, punching in your Security Clearance Code on your Remote Access Terminal (RAT), a flexible keyboard and visual display incorporated into the left forearm of your uniform which you can use to communicate with CAIN via the building's Service Computer. The link opens. Do you:</p>

<p>Lord Speke's mind falls under your control. You hold him there as Alexander, exhausted, drops his sword again. Some of his men arrive in time to defend him. Within moments, the tide of battle is turned completely and the Macedonians, driven wild by the danger to their king, begin to massacre the townspeople. Alexander is borne away by several soldiers to be tended by the doctors in his tent. When the danger is past and the battle moved on, you take Lord Speke up to the hills. Looking into his mind you see that he has been breaking the First Law of TIME and living as an ancient Greek. He has always been careful not to upset the timelines seriously, but he knows he has been acting wrongly. His collection of ancient Greek weapons in his Time Machine is authentic and he has even buried ancient artifacts in places where he could 'discover' them as archaeological finds in the 31st century. Speke is not the Renegade Lord, and you release him from your control. Tears run down his face as he realises his hobby is over. 'At least', he says, 'I can say I saw the man whose people thought he was a god.' He asks you how you discovered him and you tell him about your mission. He is shocked by the news of a traitor Lord but offers a few words of advice: 'It is not likely to be either Pilota, or myself -we are both Earther stock and interference with Earth's past might mean that we had never existed.' You thank Speke but feel obliged to order him to return to 3033 AD and give himself up. Downcast, he agrees and returns to his Time Machine while you continue with your mission. Turn to 272.</p>

<p>He leaps at you as you grab for your blaster and trigger it just in time. A white bolt of superheated plasma eats into his chest. To your surprise, sparks fly and there is the unmistakable tang of vaporised metals. A nearby Plasma Sensor begins to flash and the siren of a Citpol jetcopter wails as the 'cydroid' buckles, short-circuiting in a sea of sparks, before falling inert. You have been fighting a machine. You examine it, but the damage is too severe for you to gain a clue as to its origins, before two Enforcers alight from their 'copter, pointing their stun-lances at you. 'Let's see your ID'. You produce your ID chip and hand it to the one who spoke, still covered by the other. He clips it into the Remote Access Terminal (RAT) on his arm and a look of disappointment crosses his features as he realises who you are. 'What's been going on here?' he says. You report exactly what happened and he returns your chip and turns to examine the cydroid. Turn to 137.</p>

<p>The ambulance trundles on towards Napoleon and you sense that the Renegade Lord is reaching out to control the Emperor's mind. You can no longer see Bloodhound and decide to attack when Napoleon begins to order the Imperial Guard to advance. As you do so, the Renegade Lord becomes aware of you and a wave of mental energy flows into you - your brain goes haywire. You seem to feel hot, cold, rain and fire all at once. It is as if you can see all colours at the same time and myriad voices speak every word in every language you have ever studied. Your brain overheats, literally burning itself out like a faulty electric motor. You are a zombie, incapable of thought, gurgling like a baby. You have failed.</p>

<p>Your mind is gripped like a vice and there is nothing you can do as your hand is forced inside your jacket. Sweating with effort, you try to stop yourself aiming your blaster at Bloodhound. Your arm quivers as you line him up in your sights. Bloodhound realises what is happening and reaches for his own blaster. He is too late. The lightning bolt of plasma hurls him into the wheel of the ambulance and his corpse slumps, a grotesque travesty of a human being. Your eyes are riveted on the muzzle of your death-dealing blaster as, inch by inch, you are forced to point it at yourself. Your hand is still shaking but your finger closes on the trigger and the left half of your face and head is wiped away. You have failed.</p>

<p>Your attack fails and is returned by a mental blast far more powerful than your own. You sink to the ground feeling as if your brain is boiling. Your brain is about to burn out like a faulty electric motor when the Renegade Lord's attention is shifted to Bloodhound who is making an attack of his own, saving your life as he does so. You fall unconscious and your powers of Think- strike will never again be what they were. Subtract one from your ThinkstrikeModifier. When you awake, Bloodhound is coming round, lying next to you. You shake your heads to clear the pain and look up to see that the Imperial Guard are marching to the attack. The Renegade Lord is changing history. You both begin to run up the hillside and the ambulance comes into view a hundred yards away from the Emperor. Turn to 344.</p>

<p>You step from the pedway at an interchange but dart into a | construction tunnel leading down to Old Geneva on the lower levels. As you emerge into the low-life area of the city the stench of sewers bathes you. The dark, squat buildings are made of old- fashioned concrete, a few even are of bricks, which you have only seen before in architectural museums. The Enforcers of Citpol seldom penetrate to these depths, preferring to leave the lowlifers to their own devices. There are no pedways or Plasma Sensors down here, just graffiti and cracked tarmac. You plunge into a blank-eyed crowd of leisure zombies, milling around the sim-combat booths, unnoticed, and unfollowed. You search for a different way back to the upper levels. Turn to 146.</p>

You pull it out but are losing blood. Lose 4 Endurance points. Panting, you kneel in the cockpit and fire up the flyer's Drive and the ladder slowly retracts. The flyer rocks unsteadily as if the stabilisers were malfunctioning. Looking down, you see the dark eyes, wide with fright, of a Mongol guard swinging from the ladder, a torch burning in his hand. You dip the flyer down across the pool, plunging him into the water and the flyer bucks skyward as he falls from the ladder. Realising that all of the guards on the ground are now alerted you decide to risk hovering above the palace roof, hoping to find the balcony on which Ogedai appeared earlier. Turn to 28.</p>

<p>You cannot control Speke, his mind is too strong, but he has realised you are here. Alexander, exhausted, drops his sword and Speke, picking it up, defends him from attack. Within moments, the tide of battle is turned completely and the Macedonians, driven wild by the danger to their king, begin to massacre the townspeople. Alexander is borne away by several soldiers to be tended by the doctors in his tent. When the danger is past and the battle moved on, Lord Speke approaches carrying Alexander's sword and gives himself up.

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Efficient, calm, and a good leader. Yelov is sparing with words but what he says usually counts. He has had a glittering career in the Siriun Navy as a test pilot for Time Travel and now within the Temporal Investigative and Monitoring Executive. He is ambitious and dedicated to his work. His close friends all belong to the small community of Siriuns living on Earth. He is much respected, if not well liked and his standing within TIME is high. He is extremely deadly, proficient in most forms of combat and was personally responsible for the training of Special Agent Lynx in this area.</p>
<h2>Homeworld</h2>
<p>Sirius Secundus. Population: 12.576 billion. Sirius Secundus is an Earth type, but cool world, rich in minerals and with a strong economy. As the sun, Sirius, gradually wanes the Siriuns are beginning to emigrate in increasing numbers from their dying world.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic History</h2>
<p>The Siriuns are fiercely independent members of the Space Federation, which they joined in order to gain the secrets of space travel. Trade between Sirius and other worlds is now flourishing.</p>

You step down off the ladder and catch your breath as you find yourself waist deep in freezing water. You have climbed down into the ornamental pond. You stand still, waiting to see if you've been heard, then wade out trying not to splash and walk stealthily between cherry trees towards the torch-lights of the palace. Pausing to take stock of your surroundings you notice two guards at the rear of the palace, guarding a small wooden door.

The lower level streets and pedways are thick with people; those streets which curve up to the higher levels and along the buttresses of the larger buildings bear a steady flow of skimmers, runners sparking as they contact the electrified streetmetal.

As you do so you are noticed by some people in the palace courtyard. There is an uproar. You see that silk curtains are spread across the entrance to the room. Parting them you enter a bedchamber. Inside, sitting on a large litter, swaddled in silks and furs, is Ogedai Khan, still weak from his illness. He looks up, his narrow eyes questioning your purpose. Golden statues, treasure chests and tapestries line the walls. The door opens and two men burst in, brandishing swords, alerted by the noise of the crowd. One is a member of the Khan's Imperial Guard, dressed immaculately in black and gold lacquered armour, the other an older man, a general or 'Noyan', wearing a simple wrap-around leather cloak lined with fur.

You run up to the ambulance, but before you arrive the hunt explodes and a flyer accelerates out of it.

Quickly you search the ambulance and find a small capsule.

<p>You call up the Free Fall Recreation Centre at Spiro's Ringworld, a massive wheel-like world-in-miniature, orbiting earth. Their holo-coordinator seems to appear in your Time Machine. She is a striking girl, her skin tinted blue with orange flashes. She puts you through to Lord Pilota's personal assistant. He is a bony, hollow-cheeked man, showing signs of the Medawar Syndrome, the onset of rapid ageing. You identify yourself and ask for Her Lordship and the hologram winks out momentarily. When the holo-picture of the assistant reappears, he says: 'Lord Pilota is temporarily indisposed. Under no circumstances may she be contacted at the moment. If you would care to visit Spiro's Ringworld, however, she will be pleased to grant you immediate audience, as she believes she has some information which may interest you, as an Agent of the TIME Police.'</p>
<p>With that, he breaks contact and the blue-skinned coordinator Informs you that the line has been closed to all callers and asks: 'What is that weird spaceship you're in?' CAIN informs you that in lieu of requisitioning a shuttle from the Eiger Base you could dock at Spiro's Ringworld in eighteen minutes.

<p>Your aim was true. A lancing white bolt of superheated plasma erupts against one of the guards. He is blown back against the end wall of the corridor and then slumps to the floor. The second guard runs off as two security droids arrive. You walk up to the fallen man after giving your Security Code to the hovering droids as they aim their stun-lasers at you. You identify yourself. Satisfied, they begin to hunt the second assassin. Your fallen assailant is dying, there is nothing you can do. You ask who sent him, and lean close to hear him gasp: 'Time Lord ...', but the rest is lost in a spasm of coughing as he dies. You head back to the safety of Falcon's Wing. Turn to 336.</p>

<p>For three hours you circle the hill near Shevardino on which Napoleon's Command Post is set up, but there is no sign of the Renegade Lord. At one time, Napoleon is forced to receive the attentions of an Army surgeon and you overhear a rumour that he may have had a minor stroke. He recovers, however, and you continue your vigil. Bloodhound looks at you and motions you to concentrate - soon you can feel a presence approaching, a very strong mental presence. Your heads turn as one towards a strange contraption coming nearer Napoleon and his escort. Two horses, one behind the other, are harnessed to a wooden, covered wagon with two small holes high up on either side for windows and doors which open at the back. A medical orderly is riding the first of the horses. It is one of the first ambulances ever made of the pattern designed by Baron Larrey, a French Army Surgeon, in 1805. The strength of the mental presence within the ambulance leads you to believe that the Renegade Lord must be inside, and you prepare to attack together. Turn to 53.</p>

<p>The Creche tumble, stunned, onto the tree carpet and you move forward to make sure of your victory. Suddenly, Agidy Yelov, wearing a Psionic Damper Circlet on his head, that gives protection from mental attacks, appears from behind the Creche's Time Machine and a bolt of white lightning leaps from his blaster, burning the Hivers to a crisp. You hesitate in surprise as he turns to you, his blaster pointing at the ground. 'Well done Falcon, Bloodhound. Of course you know that I had set up a trap for the Renegade Lord, but I really must congratulate you for a truly outstanding performance against the Creche.' Bloodhound looks at you to see what you will do. Will you:</p>

MarshalNey has flung his men at the Russians, confident of success now that he has reinforcements. Unfortunately, your ancestor, the young hussar, is killed leading the charge and all goes black.

<p>Pilota responds, her voice high-pitched in the thin air, 'I noticed yesterday that someone has spent much time researching the history of Earth around the Timehole of 1241 AD. A very great deal of time, according to the Central Library Log. I suggest you make it your first mission to investigate that Timehole, just in case someone is doing something they shouldn't be. I know that there isn't much to go on here; call it a hunch if you like, but I would appreciate it if you would move quickly and check that all is well.'</p>
<p>You decide to keep your real mission secret and return to Earth for further information. Saluting Pilota and taking your leave, you are back at the console of your Time Machine within thirty minutes. CAIN confirms that what Pilota says about the library is true and that Pilota herself is not the one who has researched this part of Earth history.</p>

<p>You miss the Hornet and it finds its target. To your surprise it is not filled with explosive but with a drug which sends you quickly to sleep. You wake again some minutes later to find Lynx and Bloodhound struggling on the ground, locked in combat. Bloodhound is bleeding badly and Lynx is manoeuvring so that she can finish him off with the knife she is wielding. You move quietly over and chop her in the back of the neck, knocking her out cold. Bloodhound sighs with relief and thanks you. Looking around, you take stock of the situation. Everybody has moved off down the hill towards the line of battle. The Imperial Guard are marching to the attack and the ambulance, too, is trundling away down the hill. Napoleon has ordered the attack and the Renegade Lord has changed the past. Turn to 344.</p>

The fate of the Khan's assassin is not a pleasant one. They discuss your punishment which will be to have molten silver poured into your eyes and ears, before you are boiled alive, a death reserved for their respected enemies.

<p>Despite the fall of Clone, they come on, howling for revenge and you are faced with a solid wall of spiked steel. You are dashed backwards into Machine's bike and before you can pull yourself up, one of them turns off his hover rotor, allowing his bike to settle heavily on your legs. Several others dismount, laughing cruelly. You stare at the spiked metal-capped boots which soon start to kick you senseless. Grabbing your helmet, they leave you for dead. Lose 16 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you cannot use your mental powers until you have taken a new helmet from the equipment locker of your Time Machine.</p>

Declining further sedation you discharge yourself from the hospital and board a hovrail car in the Vault.

You step through a small personnel door, past two security droids and into the cavern which houses the TimeMachines and the Research Section of TIME. The area in which the machines are kept is partitioned at intervals and you head straight for your own bay.

<p>You wend your way through the fog of battle but your horse catches its foot in a burrow and goes lame. You abandon it and continue on foot, but in the cannon smoke you lose your way. The sound of firing is all around you and you mistake some Russians for Frenchmen who are withdrawing for a new attack When the smoke clears you realise you have wandered close to the Russians. Bugles sound behind you and a charge of French infantry is launched with Marshal Ney at their head. The Frenchmen, singing the Marseillaise, come on shoulder-to- shoulder, magnificent in their blue and white uniforms. You are swept up in the charge and carried forward, unable to do anything against the hundreds of men, exhilarated in the heat of battle. On the redoubt ahead of you, the Russian commander, Prince Bagration, rides out in front of his line of green jacketed men and salutes the French columns, crying in French, 'Bravo, messieurs, c'est superbe!' As you approach Bagration's men they unleash a hail of musket fire and you take this opportunity to throw yourself to the ground as if dead, and let the charge pass over you.</p>
<p>Afterwards, battered and muddied, you pick yourself up. You have found no trace of the Renegade Lord and you decide to return to Napoleon's Command Post at Shevardino in case Bloodhound needs help. You are approaching the Command Post when Bloodhound rides to greet you. You tell him of your experiences and decide to look for Murat, the King of Naples, when you both feel a presence approaching, a very strong mental presence.

They walk through the door with a rolling, bandy-legged gait and you follow entering a store room lined with barrels of Koumiss, fermented mare's milk. A row of carcasses hangs on hooks above a smoking fire. In the corner lies the huddled form of an unconscious mongol, obviously drunk. The two guards lead you out of a door opposite into a banqueting hall whose walls are lined with gold, the plunder of half the world. It is full of mongols, eating and drinking. To your surprise there are no tables, but a great fire has been lit in the centre of the hall. Musicians are playing fast rhythmic music and some of the mongols strut around the fire, showing off the splendour of their leather coats, decorated and lined with fur. Others are still gorging themselves, tearing chunks of meat from whole carcasses with their hunting knives. As the music quickens, some begin to whirl and leap around the fire, dancing wildly.

<p>The battle is fierce but soon Bloodhound is attacking your mind and before you can recover he has blasted you again. You double up as the plasma bolt hits your side - lose 13 Endurancepoints. If you are still alive, you find yourself too stunned to do anything. Bloodhound walks over to your stricken body and levels his weapon for the final blast. 'Wait, Bloodhound! Kill me and the population of all Earth and the colonies may perish. I am helpless, but look at CAIN's memory banks before you void me.' He hesitates, then drags you into Falcon's Wing and ties you up. Examining CAIN's records, it soon becomes obvious to him that you are on a vitally important mission and that his mission to kill you must be abandoned. He unties you, but your wounds are so bad you must subtract one from your Evasion Modifier.</p>

<p>The outside camera begins to swivel, showing you the land all around. Behind you is a forest, shrouded in snow, and the Hologram Generator disguises Falcon's Wing as part of this forest. You are on high ground and to the right you can see a village with a pall of smoke rising above it. Outside the village is a mound of bodies, each missing both ears. The mongols have been busy. Ahead, the frosted ground falls away into a wide river valley. The river is frozen over but you can plainly see its graceful curves stretching to a walled city a few miles away. Here and there on the plain you can see parties of horsemen riding swiftly. You ask CAIN for some historical information. CAIN responds. 'It is winter, 1241 AD. The city you see is Vienna and the river, the Danube. The mongol horde led by the general, Subatai, has conquered Russia and Poland, and defeated a western army at Liegnitz, before overrunning Hungary. They are a few miles from Vienna, poised to ravage the rest of Europe. Their ruler is Ogedai, son of Genghis Khan. He will die within the next few days and when the news reaches the Golden Horde, they must, under Genghis Khan's code of law, the Yasa, return to the mongol capital, Karakorum, to decide who will succeed him. Vienna will not fall and Europe will be saved.'</p>
<p>You break in, 'And if Ogedai should live?'</p>
<p>CAIN continues, The likelihood is that Europe would be overrun and the timelines changed beyond recognition. Civilisation would be set back a thousand years.'</p>
<p>As you reach for your holo-detector, a black disc-like shape crosses your path of vision, streaking skyward with a sound like a thunderclap. CAIN chimes, 'A small Ion Drive craft, probably a flyer, has taken off nearby.' You ask for an estimate of its destination and CAIN responds, 'I estimate China. The mongol capital, Karakorum, is in China, Falcon.' Do you:</p>

<p>Bloodhound passes out, slumping to the floor of the refuelling bay. You drag him to Falcon's Wing and tie him up in front of CAIN, removing his Psionic Enhancer helmet as you do so. When he comes round you show him CAIN's records. It soon becomes obvious to him that you are on a vitally important mission and that his mission to kill you must be abandoned. You untie him and return his helmet. Bloodhound says, I'm sorry, Falcon, someone has used me, someone who wants the timelines to be changed.'</p>
<p>'Who gave the order to kill me?' you ask.</p>
<p>'Our Section Chief, Agidy Yelov,' he replies. 'He told me you had killed Lord Kirik.'</p>

<p>A lancing white bolt of superheated plasma strikes the cydroid which short-circuits in a flood of sparks and pitches forward, inert. A nearby Plasma Sensor begins to flash, signalling Citpol Enforcers, the civil police. A blue and gold Citpol jetcopter lands nearby as you examine the charred remains of the cydroid, but the damage is too severe for you to gain a clue as to its origins. Two Enforcers alight from their 'copter, pointing their stun- lances at you. 'Let's see your ID.' You produce your ID chip and hand it to the one who spoke, still covered by the other. He clips it into his Remote Access Terminal (RAT) on his arm and a look of disappointment crosses his features, as he realises who you are. 'What's been going on here?' he says.

<p>The silver doors hiss apart, affording you your first view of the Hall of Honours, which boasts a marble floor and colonnades. In the centre is a large oaken table, in the shape of a horseshoe, the only wood in the TIME building, around which sit the five Lords of TIME. Your Universal Translator synthesises an unusual watery gurgling into words of welcome that sound in your ear:</p>
<p>Welcome, Agent Falcon, never has a candidate graduated from the Academy with so high a score.' Your self-control allows you to smother any outward betrayal of surprise at the sight of the being which greets you. Submerged in a huge tank, along with some small aquatic mammals, is what looks like a giant lobster with bloated bluish brain-sacs floating under its spiked carapace. It waves a fearsome purplish pincer and clicks and gurgles: 'I am Time Lord Kirik of the Keladi.'</p>
<p>You bow respectfully and turn to look at the other Lords. You recognise Lord Speke, a dapper little Earther in a Navy 'dress uniform'. On his left sits a squat, humanoid figure, with blue •kin and a mane of bristling white hairs - Lord Silvermane of Rigel Prime. On the other side of the table sits Lord Pilota, a seven-foot tall Lastlander woman with the fragile build and sharp-boned features of all those who live on that low gravity world. She is supported in her chair by a hydraulic exoskeleton which gives her the appearance of a robot, but it is the fifth Lord of TIME sitting on her right who looks the strangest of them all. A network of silica, like an oversized honeycomb, rests on the floor. Inside each of the six cells of the honeycomb is what looks like a giant ant, swathed in silk, like a cocoon. Their front parts protrude from the silk, plainly showing dull-red, compound eyes and wicked looking mandibles which are in constant motion. Collectively, they are called The Creche 82282 and they are six parts of a communal mind, in constant mind-link with each other. They are Hivers, a separate part of the Hive.</p>
<p>The ceremony is brief; you swear an oath of allegiance to TIME and are duly commissioned as a Special Agent. Pilota rises and steps forward, uncomfortable in the relatively high gravity of earth, and pins your wings to your chest. Your Universal Translator renders a mixed babel of applause. The ceremony is drawing to a close and you still have little information on the Lords of TIME. You know that this will be your last chance to meet them together in the same room for some time, perhaps for ever.</p>

<p>You twist and side-kick the General in the throat, knocking him senseless. The Emperor's guard aims a vicious sword cut at your head, but you duck and, spinning quickly, sweep his legs from under him. He falls to the ground with a clatter of armour and you chop down hard onto the back of his neck with your elbow, and he slumps, unmoving. You move quickly to Ogedai's bedside. Knowing what must be done and hoping to make his death look natural you place a silken cushion over Ogedai's face and press down. His hands scrabble feebly at yours, but he is too weak to resist. Ogedai's face turns purple as he dies. Suddenly, the door swings open and several members of the Imperial Guard rush in and charge at you. You try to dive through the awning to the balcony.

<p>Bloodhound's mental defences are enough to shrug off your Thinkstrike. While you pause to collect your thoughts after your effort, he blasts you once again. You double up as the plasma bolt hits your side -lose 13 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you find yourself too stunned to do anything. Bloodhound walks over to your stricken body and levels his weapon for the final blast. 'Wait, Bloodhound! Kill me and the population of all earth and the colonies may perish. I am helpless, but look at CAIN's memory banks before you void me.' He hesitates , then drags you into Falcon's Wing and ties you up.

<p>Your shock wave of thought topples one of the lancers from the saddle and Bloodhound and Lynx have been similarly successful with two of the other lancers. The remaining one catchesLynx in the shoulder before she can topple him with the power of her thought, but she grabs the lance and swings herself up on it, kicking the lancer in the face. He tumbles, unconscious, from the saddle but Lynx falls beside him. She is badly wounded and has to return to her Autodoc. She urges you to go on, saying: 'I'll see you at the Eiger Vault Rec Centre,' and wishes you luck before limping away. You run to catch up with the ambulance. Turn to 251.</p>

<p>You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole in the time of Alexander the Great. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everythingaround you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank - not even blackness exists in Null-space. You cast your thought into the void and using your Psychic Awareness locate the Timehole of Alexander the Great. When you have translated this location into co-ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take around an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points.</p>
<p>You rematerialize and the Holo-projector makes Falcon's Wing look like a bleak hillock. Your exterior camera shows a small range of desolate hills giving way to a dry plain crossed by a small river. You press 'hold' and the camera stops swivelling as a small city of mud-baked houses surrounded by tall, white stone walls and towers appears on the screen. It is what lies before the city which catches your eye. An entire army, perhaps forty thousand strong, is encamped before the city walls. The tattered tents are braced against the breeze and hundreds of wagons stand in a second camp further from the city, where gaggles of wagoners, camp followers and walking wounded seem to mock the orderly precision of the ranks of men, resplendent in their armour, the sun glinting from the tips of their sixteen-foot-long spears. They stand as if on parade. You ask CAIN what happened here, historically, He chimes. This city is the local capital. The people marches out to give battle to Alexander the Great and his army of Macedonians and troops from other conquered lands, two days ago, but fled when they saw Alexander and his men Alexander is returning from India to Babylon, the capital of his new empire and has decided to take this city. His men do not want to risk their lives again and he will soon head the assault in an attempt to inspire them. Realising that he is going to risk his life, his men will throw themselves onto the siege ladders, but these will be broken in their eagerness. Two men only will be with Alexander when he jumps down into the city and he will be severely wounded before the Macedonians break down the gates and rescue him ...'</p>
<p>'Thank you CAIN,' you interrupt. 'What action would change the Timeline here?'</p>
<p>CAIN says, The assassination of Alexander would seem the most likely option, but I cannot compute the effect this would have on the past. Alexander will die in only a few years from now at the age of-thirty-three and his empire will be divided up and fought over by his successors.' CAIN programmes the Molecular Converter to create the dress of a phalangite, a Macedonian warrior, and you step from Falcon's Wing wearing sandals, bronze greaves, a long heavy skirt of boiled leather strips, a breastplate, and a small round shield strapped to your left forearm. Your Psionic Enhancer becomes a crested helmet covering your face, with a Y-shaped slit for you to see through. Unable to wield a sixteen-foot-long 'sarissa' you make do with a short sword. Your blaster and holo-detector are concealed under your red cloak. You search the hills for Lord Speke's machine. Turn to 403.</p>

<p>You concentrate your mind on whoever is inside the ambulance, knowing that the Renegade Lord has a powerful will. As soon as you attack, the battle starts to go against you. The power of the will which counter-attacks is awesome and you can do nothing as you lose control of your mind. You can only watch, as an outsider, as your hand pulls the blaster from your jacket. Sweating with effort you vainly try to resist as, shaking wildly, your arm takes aim at Bloodhound. He sees you and draws his own blaster. You are about to shoot him against your will when a blast of white-hot plasma rips into your shoulder. Lose 10 Endurance points. At least no blood flows - the plasma from the blaster seals the wound like boiling tar. The shock to your system allows you to try and reassert your own will. Make a Chance Roll.</p>

<p>You are half in and half out of null-space. You are able to see through the walls of your Time Machine and even through your own flesh as if they did not exist. You try to switch the Variac Drive on again, but nothing happens. You are caught in a time flux. Unable to do anything else, you look around. You arc hanging in the air above verdant pastures and a wide blue river Before you is a magnificent city, its houses, mosques and minarets surrounded by a high and well-defended wall. Gold and turquoise gleam below in the sun. The pastures and groves are deserted but around the walls is a horde of mongols, beyond count. There are more horses than men - each warrior has a remount. You ask CAIN for an update on the history of this time and place. CAIN chimes, The city before you is Baghdad, on the banks of the river Tigris, in Mesopotamia. The year is 1258 AD and the people of Baghdad have been under siege for some months by the mongols, led by their general, Hulagu.'</p>
<p>The mongols, dressed in furs and leather, look strangely out of place by the warm banks of the Tigris. They wear conical helmets topped with spikes and plumes of horsehair, and strips of boiled ox-hide laced together and painted brightly, affording them the protection of armour without weighing down their horses. They carry curved swords, hooked lances and short bows made of layers of horn and wood. As you watch, some of them show off their skill, standing in their stirrups, drawing arrows from their quivers and firing them at the city walls, all in one swift, lithe movement. They cannot see you, hanging frozen in the air. As you watch, they gather together and the Caliph of Baghdad, Mustasin, walks forward from the gates of his starving city, flanked by faithful retainers. He kneels before Hulagu in a gesture of surrender. Using the external microphone, you can hear what passes between them. Mustasin is clearly petrified and he begs for his life and the lives of his people. The cold, impassive Hulagu demands to know where his treasures are hidden. Mustasin, seeing a ray of hope, tells Hulagu of his hiding place. When satisfied, Hulagu signals to his men, who massacre the Caliph and his attendants. The horrified people of Baghdad make no attempt to close the gates and the mongols sweep into the city like a tide of soldier ants.</p>
<p>You are held in the air above Baghdad for over a month, and in all that time the slaying continues, the bestial ferocity of the Mongols remains unslaked. Only after forty days and the death of 800,000 people does the stench of rotting flesh force Hulagu to abandon the smouldering palaces, mosques and libraries of the dead city. After they have gone you cannot see even a dog or cat moving in the streets - all life has been wiped out. Shaken by the awful spectacle you have had to witness you are thankful when your Psychic Awareness registers a change in the flux of time You engage the Variac Drive once more and this time rematerialise as planned. Because you were trapped in a time flux, when you materialise no time has passed between the moment you were caught and the moment you were released.

<p>You float down from the Access Hatch, lowered by invisible Tractor Beams. You can smell ozone in the air of the Spaceport. Rounding a bulkhead you come across a refuelling bay and your holo-detector indicates that the Keladi scout ship in front of you is in fact a Time Machine. Judging by its size it could only be that of Lord Kirik. There is no trace of Lord Speke's machine. As you walk through the hologram you are surprised to see water underfoot. Kirik's machine is normally water-filled, a much larger model than your own. Clearly all is not well for, as you look up, you see that his Access Hatch is open and on automatic, for his Mind Scan is not operating and you are drawn up into his machine. The grotesque body of Lord Kirik lies inert across his crash couch, the disc which is his Psionic Enhancer lies in a pool of water at his side. The usually bloated brain-sacs are flaccid and his jointed legs curled unnaturally. Looking more closely you notice a neat circular wound in the middle of one of his brain sacs, still pouring purplish fluid. There is no sign of the weapon that was used to do this. He has been killed quite recently by someone whom he had allowed into his Time Machine. There is no helping Lord Kirik. Do you:</p>

Silvermane also consults his RAT, but for longer than the time needed to summon a hovcar, even for an alien. Before he enters his hovcar, AgidyYelov's call-sign flashes on your micro-display. You accept his transmission and he asks you how your investigation is progressing. You reply that it has not progressed far, but give a brief report. Yelov thanks you and breaks contact. You enter a hovcar and lock it onto the trail of Silvermane and follow him. An hour later he debarks at the GalacticTrade Centre. As your own hovcar glides to a halt, Yelov calls you to his office at TIME headquarters, a journey which takes a further fifty minutes. He cannot see you immediately and you wait for over an hour before deciding to return to the Eiger Vault. As you approach its gates you are suddenly engulfed in blackness. Then you find yourself in a smoke-filled shelter, a fugitive from an alien race on your own world. The past has been changed and your memories with it.

<p>You are half in and half out of null-space. You are able to see through the walls of your Time Machine and even through your own flesh as if they did not exist. You try to switch the Variac Drive on again but nothing happens. You are caught in a time flux. Unable to do anything else, you look around you. You are hanging in the air above verdant pastures and a wide, blue river, before you is a magnificent city, its houses, mosques and minarets surrounded by a high and well-defended wall. Gold and turquoise gleam below in the sun. The pastures and groves are deserted, but around the walls is a horde of mongols, beyond count. There are more horses than men - each warrior has a remount. You ask CAIN for an update on the history of this time and place. CAIN chimes, 'The city before you is Baghdad, on the banks of the river Tigris, in Mesopotamia. The year is 1258 AD and the people of Baghdad have been under siege for some months by the mongols, led by their general, Hulagu.'</p>
<p>The mongols, dressed in furs and leather, look strangely out of place by the warm banks of the Tigris. They wear conical helmets topped with spikes and plumes of horsehair, and strips of boiled ox-hide laced together and painted brightly, affording them the protection of armour without weighing down their horses. They carry curved swords, hooked lances and short bows made of layers of horn and wood. As you watch, some of them show off their skill, standing in their stirrups, drawing arrows from their quivers and firing them at the city walls, all in one swift, lithe movement. They cannot see you, hanging frozen in the air. As you watch, they gather together and the Caliph of Baghdad, Mustasin, walks forward from the gates of his starving city, flanked by faithful retainers. He kneels before Hulagu in a gesture of surrender. Using the external microphone, you can hear what passes between them. Mustasin is clearly petrified and he begs for his life and the lives of his people. The cold, impassive Hulagu demands to know where his treasures are hidden. Mustasin, seeing a ray of hope, tells Hulagu of his hiding place. When satisfied, Hulagu signals to his men, who massacre the Caliph and his attendants. The horrified people of Baghdad make no attempt to close the gates and the mongols sweep into the city like a tide of soldier ants.</p>
<p>You are held in the air above Baghdad for over a month, and in all that time the slaying continues, the bestial ferocity of the mongols remains unslaked. Only after forty days and the death of 800,000 people does the stench of rotting flesh force Hulagu to abandon the smouldering palaces, mosques and libraries of the dead city. After they have gone you cannot see even a dog or cat moving in the streets - all life has been wiped out. Shaken by the awful spectacle you have had to witness you are thankful when your Psychic Awareness registers a change in the flux of time. You engage the Variac Drive once more and this time re- materialise as planned. Because you were trapped in a time flux, when you materialise no time has passed between the moment you were caught and the moment you were released. Your digital clock shows that in 3033 AD it is still the same day on which you began your mission. Turn to 106.</p>

<p>The mongols are clever hunters, used to the night and the smells of the wild. Before you realise it you are running into the midst of one of the groups tracking you, appearing like demons from the darkness. You are overwhelmed and carried helplessly to the ornamental pool. Laughing cruelly, they force your head beneath the water lilies until your lungs are bursting. You try to use your mental powers but realise, too late, that your helmet was knocked from your head in the struggle. Your whole life flashes before you in the slow seconds of your death. You have failed and the Space Federation will never be.</p>

Inside is a bedchamber,and sitting on a large litter, swaddled in silks and furs, is Ogedai Khan, still weak from his illness. He looks up, his narrow eyes questioning your purpose. Golden statues, chests of treasure and tapestries line the walls. Silk awnings close off the balcony at the back of the room. Do you:</p>

<p>Your blast misses Bloodhound and loses itself somewhere in the recesses at the back of the bay. He returns your fire as the tang of ionized air fills your nostrils. You double up as the plasma bolt hits your side - lose 13 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you find yourself too stunned to do anything. Bloodhound walks over to your stricken body and levels his weapon for the final blast. 'Wait, Bloodhound! Kill me, and the population of all Earth and the colonies may perish. I am helpless, but look at CAIN's memory banks before you void me.' He hesitates, then drags you into Falcon's Wing and ties you up. Examining CAIN's records, it soon becomes obvious to him that you are on a vitally important mission and that his mission to kill you must be abandoned. He unties you, but your wounds are so bad you must subtract one from your Evasion Modifier.</p>
<p>Bloodhound says, 'I'm sorry, Falcon, someone has used me, someone who wants the timelines to be changed.'</p>
<p>'Who gave the order to kill me?' you ask.</p>
<p>'Our Section Chief, Agidy Yelov,' he replies. 'He told me you hail killed Lord Kirik.'</p>
<p>'But Kirik has only been dead a matter of minutes,' you tell him.</p>
<p>Bloodhound pauses then says, 'Yes, of course, Falcon. How can he know of Kirik's death so soon? Either he was responsible or he is in league with the traitor that did it.' Your Section Chief is working with the Renegade Lord. Turn to 255.</p>

<p>He leaps at you as you grab for your blaster and trigger it just in time. A lancing white bolt of superheated plasma eats into the cydroid's chest. Sparks fly and there is the unmistakeable tang of vaporised metals. A nearby Plasma Sensor begins to flash and the siren of a Citpol jetcopter wails as the cydroid buckles, short- circuiting in a sea of sparks, before falling inert. You have been fighting a machine. You examine it, but the damage is too severe for you to gain a clue as to its origins, before two Enforcers alight from their 'copter, pointing their stun-lances at you. 'Let's see your ID.'

<p>Bloodhound hurries back with you to your Time Machines, Falcon's Wing and Hunter, and you both set out for the only Timehole on planet Hel, 600 AD, hoping finally to corner the Creche. You may use your Autodoc to restore up to 12 Endurance points on the way. While waiting to rematerialise, you ask CAIN about planet Hel. CAIN chimes: 'Planet Hel was discovered in 2978 AD by Skirrow, head of the Research Section of TIME, during the same voyage on which he discovered Skirrow's World. It is a tropical world with many dangerous predators, and plants which can trap and digest humans. There are no intelligent life forms. The air is breathable.' It seems that planet Hel was well named by its discoverer.</p>
<p>You rematerialise at the same instant as Bloodhound and Falcon's Wing settles slightly, as if on soft ground. You are resting on the top of a tropical rain forest. The tops of the trees are flattened by a mass of tangled creepers which form a carpet so dense that CAIN mistook it for the surface of the planet. Even the weight of Falcon's Wing has only bowed it slightly. You meet outside, on the tree carpet and move towards a Time Machine, undisguised by a hologram, which rests on the foliage a hundred metres away. Your Psychic Awareness tells you that the Creche are inside. As you watch, they begin to descend from the hatch of their machine. You must act quickly. Do you shout</p>

<p>You throw yourself behind a plasteel container but are too late. Unluckily for you, this is a very advanced model and the Particle Disrupter catches your side, and uniform and flesh fizz to nothing. The siren wail of an approaching Citpol jetcopter sounds more than pleasant as you wait for the cydroid to appear behind the container. Instead it makes a superhuman leap to the edge of the loading bay and drops fifty feet to the level below, cracking the streetmetal on impact. Unaffected by the cloud of sparks this causes it disappears into the maze of the city's traffic lanes. You drag yourself to your feet in time to greet the two Enforcers who alight from the jetcopter. There are always two of the City Police, and they both cover you with their stun- lances. 'Let's see your ID.' You produce your ID chip and hand it to the one who spoke, still covered by the other. He clips it into the Remote Access Terminal (RAT) on his arm and a look of disappointment crosses his features as he sees you are a genuine SAT. 'Fun and games on your first day, eh? What have you to say for yourself?' You report exactly what happened and the Enforcer hands back your ID chip, saying, 'A file of your statement will be flashed to your Section Chief.'</p>
<p>The second says, 'I have summoned an ambulance - they'll look after you.' He leaves a Homing Beacon for the ambulance and they take off. Soon, the Health Executive ambulance is hovering above you. Two medtechs jump down with a stretcher and you are soon within one of the Autodocs, an outdated model. Your vapourised tissue is regenerated at an incredible rate, but a wound of this nature does not always heal perfectly. Subtract one from your Attack Modifier as your reactions are not what they were. Restore your Endurance points to 18. Refusing sedatives, you are soon ready to board the hovrail. Turn to 169.</p>

<p>The computer has been unable to keep your lasers targeted, due to your failure to stay on the Phocian's tail. The lasers do not fire. As you wrestle with the controls to attempt another attack, suddenly the screen flares as the Phocian Corsair opens fire on the Keladi ship, its lasers piercing the hull of the larger ship which lurches sickeningly. You are too late. As your finger moves to the fire button the Corsair ship rakes the envoy's ship again with its Pulse Lasers. There is a brilliant explosion which fills the scanner screen with light and then you are suddenly engulfed in blackness. You find yourself in a smoke-filled shelter, a fugitive from an alien race on your own world. The past has been changed and your memories with it. You leap out of the shelter to hurl a grenade at a strange alien craft on the street above you ... As Falcon, Agent of TIME, you have failed.</p>

<p>Caught by surprise Lord Silvermane's powerful body falls over your leg largely under his own momentum. With a shout of alarm he turns to look at you only to find your blaster inches from his face. 'With respect sir, I must again ask, where are you going?'</p>
<p>Barely controlling his rage he says: 'I have come for an important document, kept in the safest place I know of here on Earth, my Time Machine.' The hatch opens in response to his mind scanner and he directs you to a document holder. Looking inside you can see that it contains the blueprints of some of the most advanced Rigellian technology together with information which shows that Silvermane is carrying out a technology trade to the mutual benefit of both Earth and Rigel Prime. 'Thank you,' says Silvermane, taking the documents from you. 'I must be at the Galactic Trade Centre within the hour. Your career with TIME has been a short one has it not?' Realising that you will be powerless if your security code clearance with CAIN is stopped you decide to take a risk and tell him of your mission. He listens, at first with impatience which changes to alarm. Then I shall defer court martial, but I expect a full report of the investigation which I am sure Agidy Yelov will commission.' He turns to leave, then pauses. 'Lord Speke bears investigation if I am not mistaken,' and with that he strides to the exit of the Vault. You return to Falcon's Wing. Turn to 119.</p>

Your heads turn as one towards a strange contraption coming nearer Napoleon and his escort. Two horses, one behind the other, are harnessed to a wooden, covered wagon with two small holes high up on either side for windows and doors which open at the back. A medical elderly is riding the first of the horses. It is one of the first ambulances ever made of the pattern designed by Baron Larrey, a French Army Surgeon, in 1805.

<p>One is vapourised by the superheated blast of plasma and the other immediately throws himself to the ground. You jump over him and out of the city. Your pursuers have stopped at the gate looking for the remains of the warrior you have killed, in sheer disbelief. Hoping your actions have not seriously changed the Timelines, you arrive back at the cave mouth in time to see a large bear poking at the flyer. If you blast it you will damage the flyer.

<p>You wait outside, pretending to be wounded as the clamour inside the city increases. New siege ladders are brought up and a phalanx of men smashes through the city gates. Soon the clash of arms gives way to the screams of the townspeople as the Macedonians massacre them in the frenzy that has seized them when Alexander was lost to sight. Minutes later, Alexander, badly wounded, is carried by several soldiers from the gate to his great white tent. Your Psychic Awareness tells you that one of the nearby soldiers is Lord Speke, and he has also noticed you. He pauses, then approaches you. He is carrying a sword but he gives himself up.</p>
<p>You walk up into the hills, and he explains that for some time he has been breaking the First Law of TIME and living as an ancient Greek. He has always been careful not to upset the Timelines seriously, but he knows he has been acting wrongly. His collection of ancient Greek weapons in his Time Machine is authentic and he has even buried ancient artifacts in places where he could 'discover' them as archeological finds in the 31st century. You look into his mind, with his consent, and see that it is all true - Speke is not the Renegade Lord. Tears run down his face as he realises his hobby is over. 'At least,' he says, 'I can say I saw the man whose people thought he was a god.' He asks you how you discovered him and you tell him about your mission. He is shocked by the news of a traitor Lord but offers a few words of advice. 'It is not likely to be either Pilota, or myself - we are both Earther stock and interference with Earth's past might mean that we had never existed.' You thank Speke, but feel obliged to order him to return to 3033 AD and give himself up. Downcast, he assents and returns to his. Time Machine while you continue with your mission. Turn to 272.</p>

Suddenly, Agidy Yelov, wearing a Psionic Damper Circlet on his head, that gives protection from mental attacks, appears from behind the Creche's Time Machine and a bolt of white lightning leaps from his blaster, burning the Hivers to a crisp. You hesitate in surprise as he turns to you, his blaster pointing at the ground. 'Well done Falcon, Bloodhound.

<p>The two guards collapse against each other, propping each other up like dolls for a moment, before sliding to the ground. You slip past them to the door which opens into a store-room, lined with barrels of Koumiss, fermented mare's milk. A row of carcasses hangs on hooks above a smoking fire. In the corner lies the huddled form of an unconscious mongol, obviously drunk. You open another door opposite into a banqueting hall, the walls of which are lined with gold, the plunder of half the world. It is full of mongols, eating and drinking. To your surprise there are no tables, but a great fire has been lit in the centre of the hall. Musicians are playing fast rhythmic music and some of the mongols strut around the fire, showing off the splendour of their leather coats, decorated and lined with fur. Others are still gorging themselves, tearing chunks of meat from whole carcasses with their hunting knives. As the music quickens, some begin to whirl and leap around the fire, dancing wildly. Opposite you is a door leading outside to the palace courtyard.</p>

When he realises that you are probing his mind, the waters of his tank start to boil as his pincers thresh in anger.

<p>Twin pulses from your lasers light up the back of the Phocian's ship. You have hit part of the main drive reactor and the Corsair hangs in space, drifting. Small puffs of flame at one side of its hull show you that the pilot is using the weak retro rockets in an attempt to angle his ship towards that of the Keladi envoy. It will be a few minutes, you estimate, before he is able to target his lasers. Do you:</p>

<p>You try to barge one of the mongols out of the way, but fail to knock the stocky man over. He dives at you and the other guard strikes you across the back of the head with his sabre hilt. By the time you recover you have been bound hand and foot and they are examining your blaster and helmet. Powerless without the helmet, you are aghast to hear, as they carry you to the palace, that they regard you as a witch spirit of the Everlasting Blue Sky and will sew up your mouth and nostrils before killing you, lest your spirit escape to haunt them. You struggle but cannot get free. You have failed and the Space Federation will never be.</p>

<p>Your Thinkstrike works. The hussar clutches his forehead and then tumbles gracefully from the saddle into the brook with a splash.

<p>You set your two controlled mongols against the Imperial Guardsman and the general who cry the alarm. You take advantage of the battle to slip through the door and into the room beyond.</p>
<p>Inside is a bedchamber, and sitting on a large litter, swaddled in silks and furs, is Ogedai Khan, still weak from his illness. He looks up, his narrow eyes questioning your purpose. Golden statues, chests of treasure and tapestries line the walls. Silk awnings close off the balcony at the back of the room. You sense that your controlled guards will soon be defeated. You do not have much time. Knowing what must be done and hoping to make his death seem natural, you place a silken cushion over Ogedai's face and press down. His hands scrabble feebly at yours, but he is too weak to resist. His face turns blue as he dies. Suddenly the door swings open and several members of the Imperial Guard run in and charge at you. You try to dive through the awning to the balcony. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>

<p>You manage to turn the stricken ship back towards the Starport. As you do so you notice on the rear scanner an asteroid mining ship appear from behind the Asteroid Belt, and your Psychic Awareness registers the presence of a being with great powers of the mind, probably the Renegade Lord. You catch a thought, Golden Horde and then, self destruct. To your surprise the mining ship blossoms into a flowering white light, like a star gone nova, as it explodes. Is the Renegade Lord dead, you wonder? It takes all of your skill to land the under-powered Corsair ship which groans and shudders during re-entry but, thankfully, gains the safety of the Starport, after a very hard landing. Wasting no time, you run to Falcon's Wing before Starport Security come to question you.

<p>A nearby outcrop of rock proves to be a hologram. Lord Speke or another traveller in time is here. You walk through the hologram and see a Model B Time Machine, that of one of the human or humanoid Lords of TIME. From the markings you guess it to be that of Lord Speke and, surprisingly, he has left the Access Hatch on automatic, an extraordinarily careless mistake. You are drawn up into the machine and come to rest on the Access Disc. Lord Speke, dressed as a Macedonian soldier, is sitting in his crash couch, examining a Macedonian sword of unusually fine craftsmanship. He has not noticed you. The floor of his machine is strewn with maps, charts and texts in the languages of the period. There is a beautiful wooden display cabinet full of ancient Greek weapons, including a fine collection of swords which appear to be originals, showing no sign of age, as if they had been cast quite recently. His Molecular Converter has not been used recently, despite Speke's clothes. Then he looks up and sees you. You remove your helmet and he recognises you.</p>
<p>'Falcon, you have caught me in the act,' he says despondently. He says he will give himself up and he explains that for some time he has been breaking the First Law of TIME and living as an ancient Greek. He has always been careful not to upset the Timelines seriously, but he knows he has been acting wrongly. His collection of ancient Greek weapons is authentic and he has even buried ancient artifacts in places where he could 'discover' them as archaeological finds in the 31st century. You look into his mind, with his consent, and see that it is all true - Speke is not the Renegade Lord. Tears run down his face as he realises his hobby is over. 'At least,' he says, 'I can say I saw the man whose people thought he was a god.' He asks you how you discovered him and you tell him about your mission. He is shocked by the news of a traitor Lord but offers a few words of advice. 'It is not likely to be either Pilota, or myself - we are both Earther stock and interference with Earth's past might mean that we had never existed!' You thank Speke, but feel obliged to order him to return to 3033 AD and give himself up. Downcast, he assents. You leave and return to Falcon's Wing to continue with your mission. Have you spoken with Special Agent Bloodhound since your mission began? If you have, turn to 338. If you have not, turn to 52.</p>

<p>You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole on Earth, 2700 AD. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and, using your Psychic Awareness, locate the Timehole of Earth 2700 AD. When you have translated this location into co- ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points.</p>
<p>Your external camera pivots, showing a large Starport loading hangar which appears to be completely automated. An Andromeda class Star Freighter of the series commissioned in 2692 AD, to supply the outer colonies, rests nearby, its immense cargo doors open for the robot cranes and packers. A line of the robot packers is quite close to Falcon's Wing which is disguised by hologram to resemble a large cold store. CAIN tells you that you are in the Calgary Starport and that the Star Freighter is the Earth Federation ship Frank Whittle, named after the inventor of the jet engine used in aeroplanes of the 20th century. It is being loaded with supplies for the new colony world of Ascension, in particular the serum which will save almost the entire population from the deadly viral infection which broke out about ten days ago and is ravaging the colony. You can see no sign of Speke or his machine, but it could easily be beyond the Freighter. You decide to check the hangar with your holo- detector and CAIN prepares the uniform of a maintenance technician of 2700 AD in the Molecular Converter. You put on the boiler suit with its markings proclaiming you a grade 3 Robotech, attached, to Calgary Starport. You are walking towards the Freighter, when with a hiss and a screech the boom of a packing robot descends upon you as if you were a piece of cargo. Its huge grab opens - evidently it intends to pack you!</p>

They are armed with shortbows, hooked lances and curved swords. Their weathered yellow faces with oriental eyes and black moustaches are creased with the joy of slaughter. Many have conical helmets, spiked with a plume of horsehair at their centre. They wear painted strips of ox hide, laced together for armour over leather jackets and breeches.

A third, larger ship appears on the Scanner beyond an Asteroid Belt, and the Corsair "changes course to intercept. You match course and increase speed as a second message reaches you, this time from the larger ship. This is the Clanship Keladan III; we are on a priority diplomatic mission. Do not attack. Repeat, do not attack. Change course. We are Keladi, do not attack.'

<p>You hurtle away from Karakorum and soon see a greyness on the horizon ahead of you. When the flyer slows down near Vienna you are in daylight once more, but the sun is low in the sky. The flyer descends gently into Falcon's Wing and the launch doors open automatically and the crash couch swivels and slides down into position before the instrument console. CAIN greets you with the information that the flyer you sensed leaving Karakorum as you arrived there returned to the Time Machine that you located near to your own. This machine then winked out, but another has recently arrived. Next CAIN flashes up a camera shot of the ground outside Falcon's Wing and you see Special Agent Bloodhound, focussing his holo-detector. You descend to the frost-rimed ground, greeting him. Bloodhound's news is that Yelov summoned him after he had returned to the Eiger Vault and reported you dead. When Bloodhound arrived, Yelov was deep in thought, studying a map of Borodino, a battle that took place on Earth in the year 1812 AD. As the doors slid open to allow Bloodhound in, Yelov had covered the map over, hut not before the agent had caught sight of it. He entrusted Bloodhound with a message capsule, instructing him to open it in the hovrail on his way back to the Eiger Vault and then asked him how it was, if he had killed you, that Falcon had been reported as being alive in Earth's past at the time of the Golden Horde. Bloodhound feigned innocence and threw the message capsule away, after checking it, and finding that it was a bomb designed to kill him. He travelled straight to the time of the Golden Horde in the hope of meeting you and suggests you both travel to Earth, 1812 AD, where there is a Timehole situated conveniently close to Borodino, making it easy for the Renegade Lord to change the past. Do you:</p>

<p>You tell Bloodhound that the Phocian pirate guarding the nearest Corsair ship is under mind control. Bloodhound suggests that you look into this while he returns to Earth in 3033 AD, and reports to Yelov that he has successfully killed you, so that you can operate without fear of further trouble from your comrades. When he has done that, he will explore the Timelines and help you with your mission. You thank him. 'Good luck and look after yourself, my friend,' he calls, and with that he returns to his machine, Hunter, which winks out suddenly. You look towards the sleek Phocian ships and see the pirate enter one and seal the hatch. As you watch, the Corsair's Fusion Drive fires up and the ship hurtles out of the Starport, breaking the noise and launch regulations as it does so.</p>

<p>With a great effort you manage to dominate their wills, holding them under control. You walk up to them and order them to Like you to Ogedai Khan and to pretend you are a messenger. They walk across the Palace courtyard with a rolling, bandy-legged gait and you follow. At the palace door, two more guards stare at you impassively. One of the guards, controlled by you, speaks listlessly at your command. 'We bring a messenger whose message is for the ears of Ogedai Khan and no other.' The door-guards step aside and usher you in. The doors open into a banqueting hall, the walls of which are lined with gold, the plunder of half the world. It is full of mongols, eating and drinking. To your surprise there are no tables, but a great fire has been lit in the centre of the hall. Musicians are playing fast, rhythmic music and some of the mongols strut around the fire, showing off the splendour of their leather coats, decorated and lined with fur. Others are still gorging themselves, tearing chunks of meat from whole carcasses with their hunting knives. As the music quickens some begin to whirl and leap around the fire, dancing wildly.

You hit him and he is thrown backwards, one arm and leg burnt horribly. He falls down through a gap in the tree carpet and you run to the hole and peer down. His body is pillowed on an eerily glowing mass of jelly, like a giant amoeba As you watch he moves feebly and rolls off onto the leaf mould that covers the ground. As you peer through the hole the darkness below is lit by a faint blue light. Something much larger than Yelov is slithering slowly towards him. Yelov cannot move!

<p>Before returning to Falcon's Wing you look around the rest of the refuelling bay. Two Phocian Corsair ships, sleek attack craft, have completed refuelling. A Phocian guard stands by the personnel ramp of the nearest ship, a squat humanoid with a brilliantly coloured head, like a macaw without a beak. To your surprise, your Psychic Awareness tells you that his mind is being dominated by another. Since Korakiik is the only known psionically aware Keladi at this time and he is in space orbit, a non-Keladi must be controlling him, possibly Kirik's killer and maybe the Renegade Lord. Before you can investigate, your holo-detector begins to bleep continuously. A Time Machine has materialised behind you. Spinning round, you see a figure seeming to appear from the side of a gas tank that did not exist a few moments earlier. He looks like a Phocian pirate, but on seeing you he tips back his helmet to reveal the face of TIME Special Agent Bloodhound. Like you, he has a model A3 Time Machine, now disguised as the gas tank. His thoughts brush yours and he speaks before you can greet him, his blue eyes hard, 'I'm sorry, Falcon, I have a Termination Order for you.' You realise he has been ordered to kill you, just as he draws his blaster with the lightning reactions of an elite combateer.

<p>Falcon's Wing reaches the surface and bobs gently. Your external camera revolves slowly until a floating platform comes into sight. A hideous apparition of jointed legs and bloated brain sacs slithers over its edge and is lost to the deep. Your exterior microphone amplifies a strange clicking which your Translator reads as, '... unforgivable interruption of Kelcrrrrck'ick by a non-clan member...' Apparently there is no universal equivalent for Kelcrrrrck'ick. Puzzling as to what you may have Interrupted your attention is suddenly drawn to the screen as the camera tilts down towards the surface, picking up some movement. Through the reflected glare of the Keladi sun you see what looks like a hundred-metre long sea monster with six luminous eyes about to engulf you.</p>
<p>Falcon's Wing lurches violently as it erupts from the water and you realise it is a Keladi space boat with its floodlights on, a rakish space ship shaped like a manta ray. CAIN chimes, They are requesting holophone contact,' and you open a channel. You strain back in your crash couch as Falcon's Wing fills suddenly with water and a cruel looking Keladi appears before your eyes, claws waving. Remembering it is only a holo-projection you relax and identify yourself as a. member of TIME, codename Falcon. The Keladi replies, 'It is well I arrived quickly. I am Rrillk, Argon of the TIME research station, here in the Biruk shallows. Had not I, a member of the bond-clan of TIME, arrived first you might have been treated with hostility, even attacked.' You ask where Lord Kirik is, and Rrillk informs you that he is at the research station on the sea floor.</p>
<p>You are towed slowly to the floating platform where you leave Falcon's Wing and descend to the bottom in a lift which travels down a long transparent shaft. As you descend you see various. unusual and colourful sights. A coral-cloud, flapping its way through the sea like a scarlet underwater fern and then a shoal of Gorblefish, rainbow-hued fish with anemone heads. At the foot of the shaft, a man, Garren, is waiting, one of the consultants at the research station. He welcomes you to the air breathing section, a large, transparent dome around which several Keladi gather to stare at you. Garren informs you that Lord Kirik recently travelled into Kelados' past, to the timehole in 2710 AD. You tell Garren that you must follow him immediately and he accompanies you to the surface in the lift As you take your leave, Garren hands you a small container of pills, which he tells you are synthesised from the gills of Skorarli, the sleek predator of the depths of Kelados. They stimulate the reflexes. You thank him and take one before entering your Time Machine. Add one to your Evasion Modifier and note on your Agent Profile that you have a supply of these pills You quickly instruct CAIN to switch on the Variac Drive and, using your Psychic Awareness, plot your course through null space to the Timehole in Kelados' past.

Next, you use the mechanical sounding voice box of your Translator to order the mongols to leave the village. Their leader kneels before you and offers homage and the rest follow suit. 'We obey, O spirit of the Everlasting Blue Sky,' he says, and they mount up and ride quickly away. The villagers gaze at you in fear and astonishment. Wasting no time, you gather up the clothes and the nuclear bomb and return to the safety of Falcon's Wing, hoping your actions have not seriously damaged the Timelines. You ask C A I N to what extent you have changed the past, and, to your relief, he responds, 'There is no significant change, Falcon. My files do carry a tale, however, about a sorcerer who saved the village of Ramallo from the mongol Horde, for a little while. Congratulations, Falcon, you are the sorcerer of Ramallo.'

Suddenly, the scanner screen lights up fiercely; you have scored a direct hit on his Power Plant and the Phocian has been vapourised with his ship.

<p>You emerge from the greyness of null-space into a huge spaceport on an artificial island, built so that the Keladi could trade with other spacefaring races without forcing them to adapt to an undersea environment. The huge, vaulted Starport stretches for miles on each side; you can count more than forty different types of spacefaring vessels. The holo-generator throws the image of a large aluglass container around Falcon's Wing and the camera shows that nobody has noticed its sudden appearance. You ask CAIN for historical details of Kelados in 2710 AD. It chimes, 'At this moment in time the Keladi are on the brink of war with the Earth Federation. Reason: border incidents misinterpreted by Keladi as being a way of testing their defence systems. The Keladi, at this time, do not realise that many humans break the Earth Federation's laws and suppose that if one human kills a Keladi, his "clan", or all Earthers, approve his action. Phocian pirates are being encouraged to use Keladi Starports as bases from which to prey on Earth Federation shipping.'</p>
<p>What could be done to change the Timeline here?' you interrupt.</p>
<p>CAIN waits for some seconds before replying: 'I can see one method of changing the Timeline which would be both easy to do and disastrous in effect. The Keladi envoy, Korakiik, a telepath, regarded as insane and "clanless" by the Keladi, but the only one who, through his psionic power, understands the EarthFederation and humans is shortly due to leave Kelados orbit to meet an Earth envoy. Historically, he was responsible for preventing a war which would probably destroy both civilisations. To prevent this meeting would change the timeline to a greater degree than I can compute.' You find yourself thanking CAIN as you pull on the uniform of a Phocian pirate which CAIN has already instructed the Molecular convertor to prepare. Your Psionic Enhancer helmet now resembles the helmet of a Phocian laser-turret operator, disguising your features. Taking your holo-detector, you set out in search of Lord Kirik. Turn to 360.</p>

<p>You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole on present day Kelados (3033 AD). Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and,using your Psychic Awareness, locate the Timehole of present day Kelados. When you have translated this location into co-ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you.

<p>You don your environmental suit as CAIN informs you that the atmosphere contains a great deal of methane gas and will not sustain human life. You descend to the floor of Dyskra. As you approach the nearest of the dark red outcroppings, the ground suddenly gives way beneath you. Repnids have tunnelled to within an inch of the surface and you fall into a boiling mass of hundreds of Repnid bodies in the cavern below. The end is swift, as several pairs of fangs inject their deadly venom and the deadly air of Dyskra contaminates your lungs. You have failed.</p>

<p>Falcon's Wing reaches the surface and bobs gently. Your external camera revolves slowly until a floating platform comes into sight. Two hideous apparitions of jointed legs and bloated brain sacs slither over its edge and are lost to the deep. Your exterior microphone amplifies a strange clicking which your Translator reads as, '... unforgivable interruption of Kelcrrrrck'ick by a non-clan member...' Apparently there is no universal equivalent for Kelcrrrrck'ick. Puzzling as to what you may have interrupted, your attention is suddenly drawn to the screen as the camera tilts down towards the surface, picking up some movement. Through the reflected glare of the Keladi sun you see what looks like a hundred-metre long sea monster with six luminous eyes about to engulf you.</p>
<p>Falcon's Wing lurches violently as it erupts from the water and you realise it is a Keladi spaceboat with its floodlights on, a rakish space ship shaped like a manta ray. CAIN chimes, They are requesting holophone contact,' and you open a channel. You strain back in your crash couch as Falcon's Wing fills suddenly with water and a cruel looking Keladi appears before your eyes, claws waving. Remembering it is only a holo-projection you relax and identify yourself as a member of TIME, codename Falcon. The Keladi replies, 'It is well I arrived quickly. I am Rrillk, Argon of the TIME research station, here in the Biruk shallows. Had not I, a member of the bond-clan of TIME, arrived first, you might have been treated with hostility, even attacked.' You ask where Lord Kirik is, and Rrillk informs you that he has just used his Time Machine to go back to the Timehole in Kelados' past, 2710 AD. You decide to follow him immediately, and thanking Rrillk for his help, disengage the holophone connection and ask CAIN to engage the Variac Drive. Turn to 281.</p>

<p>Still carrying,the nuclear bomb, you go back to Falcon's Wing, hoping your actions have not seriously changed the Timelines. You ask CAIN to what extent you have changed the past and to your relief, he responds, 'There is no significant change, Falcon.

<p>You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole in the time of Alexander the Great. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and, using your Psychic Awareness, locate the Timehole of Alexander the Great. When you have translated this location into co-ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points.</p>
<p>You rematerialise and the holo-projector makes Falcon's Wing look like a bleak hillock. Your exterior camera shows a small range of desolate hills giving way to a dry plain crossed by a small river. You press hold and the camera stops swivelling as a small city of mud-baked houses surrounded by tall, white stone walls and towers appears. A pall of smoke hangs above it and the gates have been flattened. Before the city is an army, celebrating victory, amidst piles of booty, in their camp. A stricken figure in golden armour is lying on a litter outside a great white tent, tended by doctors in grey robes. Others, soldiers and officers, stand about him, anxiously.</p>
<p>You ask CAIN what happened here, historically. He chimes, This city is the local capital. The people marched out to give battle to Alexander the Great and his army of Macedonians and troops from other conquered lands, but fled when they saw Alexander and his men. Alexander is returning from India to Babylon, the capital of his new empire and decided to take this city. His men did not want to risk their lives again and he led the assault in an attempt to inspire them. Realising that he was risking his life, his men threw themselves onto the siege ladders, but these broke in their eagerness. Two men only were with Alexander when he jumped down into the city and he was severely wounded before the Macedonians broke down the gates and rescued him, massacring the townspeople in their frenzy.'</p>
<p>'Thank you CAIN,' you interrupt. 'What action would change the Timeline here?'</p>
<p>CAIN says: The assassination of Alexander would seem the most likely option, but I cannot compute the effect this would have on the past. Alexander will die in only a few years from now at the age of thirty-three and his empire will be divided up and fought over by his successors.' CAIN programmes the Molecular Converter to create the dress of a phalangite, a Macedonian warrior, and you step from Falcon's Wing wearing sandals, bronze greaves, a long heavy skirt of boiled leather strips, a breastplate, a small round shield strapped to your left forearm and your Psionic Enhancer becomes a crested helmet covering your face with a Y-shaped slit for you to see through. Unable to wield a sixteen-foot-long 'sarissa' you make do with a shortsword. Your blaster and holo-detector are concealed under your red cloak. You search the hills for Lord Speke's machine.

<p>As unobtrusively as you can you wander through the camp, casting around with your Psychic Awareness. You pick up a variety of the soldiers' thoughts; some are full of fear at the thought of assaulting the city, others are casting their minds back to their homes in Macedon, more are simply bored, a few look forward to pillage and plunder. Suddenly the mood changes. Alexander has had a priest take the omens and they are not good, but Alexander decides to attack in any case. Anxiety spreads and most are unwilling to attack. The king orders his men to prepare to storm the city and the army organises as if by magic. Siege ladders are brought forward on carts. There is still no sign of Speke and you are curtly ordered to join a phalanx of men near the city gates. Hoping not to be noticed you take your place in one of the columns. Sensing that his men, war weary and far from home, are reluctant to storm another city after the bad omens, Alexander exhorts them to attack. They hesitate and he grabs a ladder and thrusts it against the wall. He scales it quickly, followed by his shield bearer and a member of his bodyguard, and is soon atop the wall. Seeing this, the Macedonians bring up the ladders and crying, 'Iskander, Iskander!' for that is how they say his name, they rush up the ladders, which break in their eagerness. Alexander, an obvious target, is pelted with missiles and jumps down inside the city, almost alone. Turn to 273.</p>

<p>Since the Phocian is not in control of his own mind he is defenceless against your Thinkstrike and he starts to float unconscious, in his free-fall harness. You free him from the couch and tie him up with the harness before pushing his weightless body back into your ship. By the time he comes round you are on your way back to the starport. As you head back you notice, on the rear scanner, an asteroid mining ship appear from behind the Asteroid Belt, and your Psychic Awareness registers the presence of a being with great powers of the mind, probably the Renegade Lord. You catch a thought: Golden Horde and then, self destruct. To your surprise the mining ship blossoms into a flowering white light, like a star gone nova, as it explodes. Is the Renegade Lord dead, you wonder? Then you notice the Phocian coming round and you interrogate him. Your voice is mechanical, using the Universal Translator, and he readily informs you that his mind was taken over by a very alien and powerful mind, obviously neither Keladi, Phocian nor Earther. He had been instructed to destroy the envoy's vessel. He asks what is happening, but following the First Law of TIME, you ignore him.</p>

<p>You pick your way through the mass of soldiery towards the large white tent, and are tall enough to crane your neck and see the figure of Alexander, resplendent in golden armour with a battered helmet which sports a white crest. He is a short man, but very athletic, his curly reddish-blond hair framing a deter- mined face with piercing blue eyes. Nearby, a white-robed priest is fiddling with the entrails of a sheep. He looks towards Alexander whom he calls King Iskander and strongly advises him not to attack the town, saying that the omens are bad. The soldiers mutter, but Alexander replies, 'My business is to conquer cities. I do not have time to study the entrails of sheep. Leave me alone to finish my business.' Turning to his advisers he gives the word to prepare to storm the city. The army organises as if by magic, and siege ladders are brought forward on carts. There is still no sign of Speke and you are curtly ordered to join a phalanx of men near the city gates. Hoping not to be noticed, you take your place in one of the columns. Sensing that his men, war weary and far from home, are reluctant to storm another city after the bad omens, Alexander exhorts them to attack. They hesitate and he grabs a ladder and thrusts it against the wall. He scales it quickly, followed by his shield bearer and a member of his bodyguard, and is soon atop the wall. Seeing this, the Macedonians bring up ladders and crying, 'Iskander, Iskander!' they rush up the ladders, breaking them in their eagerness. Alexander, an obvious target, is pelted with missiles and jumps down inside the city, almost alone. Do you:</p>

One collapses as the combined force of your Thinkstrike hits home. The honeycomb is on top of a flyer, similar in design to your own and you both throw yourselves back to the ground outside to avoid the Ion Drive exhaust as the flyer explodes from the front of the ambulance.

The victim of your Thinkstrike had not reached his seat in the honeycomb. Toppling backward as the flyer took off, it was vapourised by the Ion Drive. Quickly you search the ambulance and find a small capsule. It is in Interstellar Code - a message from Agidy Yelov to the Creche suggesting that if the mission is aborted, they should effect a rendezvous on planet Hel. As quickly as you can, after checking that the Emperor's Imperial Guard are not advancing, you return to your Time Machine. Turn to 161.</p>

<p>You call up the Free Fall Recreation Centre at Spiro's Ringworld, a massive wheel-like world-in-miniature, orbiting earth. Their holo-coordinator seems to appear in your Time Machine. She is a striking girl, her skin tinted blue with orange flashes. She puts you through to Lord Pilota's personal assistant. He is a bony, hollow-cheeked man, showing signs of the Medawar Syndrome, the onset of rapid ageing. You identify yourself and ask for Her Lordship and the hologram winks out momentarily When the holo-picture of the assistant reappears, he says, 'Lord Pilota is temporarily indisposed.

<p>Through CAIN you order that a shuttle be prepared for your trip to Spiro's Ringworld and waste no time. You run from the doors of the Vault across the launch bay to the small, dart- shaped shuttle with its huge, ungainly drive vents, each as large as the cabin. The navigational computer is already set as you strap into the Acceleration Web behind the pilot. With a flash of light the Ion Drive fires and you are accelerated sickeningly quickly. This is a Navy pilot - she has never flown civilian craft. Minutes later the Docking Computer locks onto the Ringworld, a glittering disc twenty miles across, turning silently in space and the deceleration is equally unpleasant. As you step out into the air-lock, the pilot turns and smiles, 'You stood that well - you must be fit.' You ask her to stand by for your return journey and enter the Ringworld.</p>
<p>Lord Pilota's assistant meets you as you emerge from the air- lock and, helping you into a jet pack, points up into the empty centre of the so-called Ringworld. You are standing on the inside rim of the disc which is rotating quickly enough to produce a gravity not far below that of Earth's. Looking up, you see the tops of the buildings, twenty miles away on the opposite side of the Rim. The assistant explains that Lord Pilota is in the gravity free zone, or free fall area, in the centre of the disc, half way to the other rim. You blast off with him confidently enough, and head for the centre of the rimworld. As you approach you see Lord Pilota, spinning slowly, head over heels, apparently at ease without the hydraulic exoskeleton she uses in Earth gravity. With a shock you realise that you cannot adapt easily to free fall and accidentally cannon into her, sending you both towards the other rim. She steadies you easily and with two deft jet-pack blasts returns you to a stationary position in free fall. She speaks, her voice high-pitched in the thin air.

<p>She laughs, 'That's ridiculous, are you insane? I asked you here to tell you that someone had been using the Central Library to investigate Earth history in 1241 AD, the time of the mongol hordes. Think again, Falcon. If Earth's past were changed, we Lastlanders would never have existed, or had you forgotten that we are Earther colonials? I don't know how you ever managed to pass the tests of the Academy. Escort Falcon back to the shuttle please, Remo.' Her assistant switches on his jet-pack and crashes into you while Pilota moves to the other rim. Two red dots appear ahead of you, growing in size until you recognise their security uniforms,'The guards obey Remo's instructions to return you to your shuttle or terminate you if you resist, and you decide to obey since you are at a severe disadvantage in free fall.

<p>You haven't long in which to stop the attack. The finest troops alive at this time. Napoleon's Imperial Guard, fresh and eager, will decisively change the course of the battle. The earlier French attacks by Marshals Ney and Davout had been repulsed and the valiant Russian Commander, Prince Bagration, had counter-attacked, but been unsuccessful. His troops were flung back and he himself has been mortally wounded. If the Imperial Guard attack the Russians will be routed and Murat's cavalry will cut them down in their thousands. The Russians will have lost this war and Europe will be plunged into wars against Napoleon for decades. The guards will meet the Russian line in minutes. Do you:</p>

<p>Ripping the ambulance doors open reveals a bizarre sight - six creatures like giant ants, mandibles clicking in agitation, are backing into a honeycomb structure, their dull, red, compound eyes menacing. One shrivels as the white-hot plasma from your blaster hits home. The honeycomb is on top of a flyer, similar in design to your own and you both throw yourselves to the ground outside to avoid the Ion Drive exhaust as the flyer explodes from the front of the ambulance. You sense that the six Hiver beings who together are Lord Creche, the Renegade Lord, are flying back to their Time Machine, with one exception. The victim of your Thinkstrike had not reached his seat in the honeycomb. Toppling backward as the flyer took off, it was vapourised by the Ion Drive. Quickly you search the ambulance and find a small capsule. It is in Interstellar Code - a message from Agidy Yelov to the Creche suggesting that if the mission is aborted, they should effect a rendezvous on planet Hel. As quickly as you can, after checking that the Emperor's Imperial Guard are not advancing, you decide to follow the Creche. Turn to 161.</p>

Catching up with Lord Silvermane you ask him where he intends to go. He replies, brusquely, 'I'm on important official business, you need not concern yourself with it.

<p>You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole on Earth, 2700 AD. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and, using your Psychic Awareness, locate the Timehole of Earth 2700 AD. When you have translated this location into co- ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points.</p>
<p>Your external camera pivots, showing a large Starport loading hangar which appears to be completely automated. An Andromeda class Star Freighter of the series commissioned in 2692 AD, to supply the outer colonies, rests nearby, its immense cargo doors open for the robot cranes and packers. A line of the robot packers is quite close to Falcon's Wing which is disguised by hologram to resemble a large cold store. CAIN tells you that you are in the Calgary Starport and the Star Freighter is the Earth Federation ship Frank Whittle, named after the inventor of the jet engine used in aeroplanes of the 20th century. It is being loaded with supplies for the new colony world of Ascension, in particular, the serum which will save almost the entire population from the deadly viral infection which broke out about ten days ago and is ravaging the colony. You can see no sign of Speke or his machine but it could easily be beyond the Freighter. You decide to check the hangar with your holo- detector and CAIN prepares the uniform of a maintenance technician of 2700 AD in the Molecular Converter. You put on the boiler suit with its markings proclaiming you a grade 3 Robotech, attached to Calgary Starport. You are walking towards the Freighter, when with a hiss and a screech the boom of a packing robot descends upon you as if you were a piece of cargo. Its huge grab opens - evidently it intends to pack you! Make an Evasion Roll.</p>

Rounding a bulkhead you come across a refuelling bay and your holo-detector indicates that the Keladi scoutship in front of you is in fact a Time Machine.

Looking more closely you notice a neat circular wound in the middle of one of his brain sacs, still pouring purplish fluid. There is no sign of the weapon that was used to do this.

You soon catch sight of Murat, the King of Naples himself, the most extravagantly dressed man on the battlefield, great cockades of white feathers adorning his busby. He looks every inch a cavalry general, dashing and stylish with long hair and a sleek look, but he is a veteran of many campaigns. He and his staff are before a thousand French heavy cavalry, the Cuirassiers with their steel breastplates and crested helmets each with its scarlet plume.

The Phocian appears to fuse into his free-fall couch, his body distorting horribly; the forward scanner screen is covered with a red film. You quickly leave the scene and return to your ship. You can only hope that his descendants were not to be shapers of history and that changes in the Timelines will be small. You have, however, saved Korakiik, the Keladi envoy and thwarted the Renegade Lord. You turn your ship back to the Starport. As you do so you notice, on the rear scanner, an asteroid mining ship appear from behind the Asteroid Belt and your Psychic Awareness registers the presence of a being with great power of the mind, probably the Renegade Lord. You catch a thought: Golden Hordes and then, self destruct. To your surprise, the mining ship blossoms into a flowering white light, like a star gone nova, as it explodes.

<p>You walk along the edge of the forest towards the village; curls of smoke wind up from the holes in the roofs of the cottages and huts. As you approach it, your holo-detector picks up a hologram - a Time Machine has been disguised as trees. Your Psychic Awareness catches a thought as if you have discovered somebody doing something they shouldn't. Abort reconnaissance you sense next. There is a click and a hiss as of a hatch opening and closing and a group of nearby trees wink out abruptly. A metre-long metal canister rolls down from the bank on which the Time Machine had stood. You run towards it and recognise it as a nuclear bomb. The digits on the timer are ticking past, like an old-fashioned 20th century fruit machine. The symbols an foreign but you guess that all of the red stars will be in line within about thirty seconds. The nuclear device appears to be of standard design and is capable of destroying Vienna and most life-forms within twenty miles of this spot. This would change history beyond recognition. As you watch, another of the red stars clicks into place on the DETONATE line. The dials click forward one space at a time and when the middle star has clicked forward three times the three stars will be lined up on the DETONATE line and the bomb will explode. Each of the three dials has three buttons above it with which you can manually move the dials 1, 2 or 3 positions onward but you don't know which button is which. You press the buttons above the two dials whose stars are on the DETONATE line, but they are locked.

<p>You bring the soldier under your control and force him to discharge his musket through a crack in the ambulance's side planking. Bloodhound suddenly tenses, controlled by the Renegade Lord and, drawing his blaster, takes aim at you. You are about to dive onto the ground when the musket goes off and Bloodhound regains control of himself. You run up to the ambulance, but before you arrive the front explodes and a flyer accelerates out of it. Six beings like giant ants, their red, compound eyes glaring at you balefully, are clinging on inside the honeycomb-like seats. One of them appears to have been killed by a musket ball. You realise it is the Hivers, Lord Creche 82282. The Creche skim low through the smoke of the battlefield, almost faster than the eye can see, making a sonic boom like the explosion of a powder magazine, the ammunition stores for the cannon. As they go you catch the thought that they are heading for the planet Hel. Do you:</p>

A stream of twenty or more guards come running from the building outside which the horses are tethered. Whispering together, they look out into the shadows fearfully.

<p>Somehow you have only managed to hit the Phocian in the shoulder. His shoulder disappears in a hiss of reddish vapour and his arm rotates gently away from his body surrounded by a cloud of small red globules. Such is the power, however, of the alien mind which controls him that he still fires his ship's lasers, piercing the hull of the envoy ship. There is a brilliant white explosion which fills the scanner screen and then you are suddenly engulfed in blackness. Then you find yourself in a smoke-filled shelter, a fugitive from an alien race on your own world. The past has been changed and your memories with it. You leap out of the shelter to hurl a grenade at a strange alien craft on the street above you... As Falcon, Agent of TIME, you have failed.</p>

<p>You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole on Earth in the Jurassic age. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and, using your Psychic Awareness, locate the Timehole on Earth. When you have translated this location into co-ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you.

Falcon's Wing settles gently into soft ooze and the holo-projector casts the image of a clump of ferns around the Time Machine. A great swampy lake stretches into the distance ahead.

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Keladi with mental powers are extremely rare. Kirik is looked upon as a mutant because of his powers and is considered 'outside caste', or classless. The metropolitan libraries all carry the rows of books needed to explain the complicated social etiquette of the Keladi. The Keladi see members of all other species, including Earthers, as below or 'outside' caste. The effect that rejection by his own class has had on Kirik is unknown. It is thought that he greatly enjoys his position is a Lord of TIME and hence as a Keladi envoy, as this gives him some standing in his home world. As with all Keladi, he has a voracious appetite and a fiery temper and retains their obsession with etiquette and politeness.</p>
<h2>Homeworld</h2>
<p>Kelados. Dominant race: Keladi. Population: 4.357 billion. Habitat: temperate seas. The surface of Kelados is 95% water and intelligent life abounds within the warm seas. Kelados is rich in a great variety of marine organisms.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic History</h2>
<p>In 2664 a diplomatic mission from Earth gave the Keladi all the information they needed to become a space-faring race. Since that time there have been no wars amongst the Keladi. In 2710, however, a series of frontier incidents sparked off by Earther pirate ships almost resulted in war, largely due to the fact that the Keladi could not understand that the actions of a few criminals, the pirates, did not involve the rest of their 'clan' - Earth. The envoy, Korakiik, averted war through his realisation that the pirates were 'outside caste', not true representatives of Earth. Lork Kirik, too, understands this difference.</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>A brilliant scientist, Speke, partly due to his mental powers, was one of two men largely responsible for the invention of the Time Machine. Like many brilliant men, he is eccentric, will not suffer fools gladly and is prone to break off a conversation suddenly, lost in thought. He is a brave man and, with Irving Klimt, undertook the first ever voyage into the past, starting from 2974. They undertook several journeys together, but Klimt never returned from an investigation of classical Greece in the time of Philip of Macedon. Lord Speke has always maintained that he was killed in a drunken brawl, by a soldier, though Klimt had always been careful not to change the past by becoming involved. With the setting up of TIME Speke was the obvious choice for appointment as the Earther Lord and he has enjoyed his position ever since. He is also well known for pioneering work on the mental attack of Thinkstrike, with which he is adept. He is also Professor of Earth Archaeology at the Academy where his specialist subject is Alexander the Great.</p>
<h2>Homeworld</h2>
<p>Earth. Population: 43.997 billion.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic History</h2>
<p>Earth, as head of the Federation, has not faced a serious threat since the Hive-war in 2934. At this time the Hivers were completely defeated in space, though few landings on their homeworld, the Hive, were successful. There has been peace on Earth for three centuries.</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Set apart by her mental powers, Pilota accepted her position as a Lord of TIME only when a gift of a solar-sail racer was offered if she agreed. She is highly intelligent, but seems not to take her responsible position as a Lord very seriously. She still seldom misses a race and is highly successful in the sport of solar-sailing which takes the courage to make a close approach to the sun and the fine judgement not to go too close. Before joining TIME, Pilota had been on the official list of space smugglers and was found not guilty of tax evasion after an investigation by the Lastlanding authorities. She prefers low-gravity environments similar to those on Lastlanding.</p>
<h2>Homeworld</h2>
<p>Lastlanding. Found accidentally in 2571 when the colony ship, Utopia, crash landed on a hospitable, but low-gravity planet. It was the first outer colony. It now has a population of 0.808 billion and still attracts immigrants from Earth. It is a world of golden opportunities and great space, where it is still possible to buy unused land. Each citizen can vote on all issues via holophone in the comfort of their own home. The police force are not kept busy, but Lastlanding has become a bolt hole for those on the run, throughout the Federation.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic History</h2>
<p>Lastlanding was a founder member of the Space Federation and increases in importance. As it does so, however, its dependence on Earth dwindles. They now control their own policy towards other worlds.</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Lord Creche 82282 is a group awareness, composed of six Hivers, These beings pool their minds in order to become a living computer. They have no personality as an Earther would describe it, but in common with all Hivers, would sacrifice themselves for the sake of the Hive, without hesitation. They are properly described as 'it', thinking and acting as one. Response to any question takes a few seconds as each inputs data before there is any reaction. The Hivers pioneered the Federation's studies of powers of the mind, inventing the Psionic Enhancer. They are thought to have developed mental powers beyond that of any other race.</p>
<h2>Homeworld</h2>
<p>The Hive. A dry, hot world, its surface dotted with cities resembling gigantic termite nests. Population (estimated): greater than 200 billion. Hiver factory workers are extremely hard working. The first to acquire weapons on their world, they eradicated all other intelligent species.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic History</h2>
<p>The Hivers were intent on conquering other worlds at the same time that Earth was building the Space Federation. They were heavily defeated in the Space War of 2934 and joined the Space Federation in the following year. They have cooperated since that date and have traded the life-prolonging drugs which give Earthers a lifespan of 250 years in return for metals.</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p>Aged, even for a Rigellian, Silvermane is the survivor of a long struggle for power on the world of Rigel Prime. Still fit and strong, he is a shrewd opponent and a pleasant comrade. He upholds the Rigellian code of honour and is proud both of himself and of his race, seeing his role as a Lord of TIME as being to further the causes of Rigel Prime. He has a liking for spartan discomfort which is often thought bizarre by Earthers.</p>
<h2>Homeworld</h2>
<p>Rigel Prime is a large, high-gravity world covered by farmland ranges. The population is 30.131 billion. Silvermane's tribe is in power but occasional differences are settled through ritual combat, no longer to the death, between chosen tribal champions. The Rigellians' culture is based upon the code of the warrior and physical strength is still prized.</p>
<h2>Diplomatic History</h2>
<p>The Rigellians developed space travel in the 1890s and first contacted Earther spaceships in 2152. There was a long history of minor frontier wars as both Rigel and Earth staked claim to various barren planets useful only for the easily mined asteroids which surrounded them. These were eventually settled after the Battle of The Flying Coffins, notable because less than 10% of the personnel involved survived it. Rigel joined the Federation soon afterwards. The Rigellians assisted the Earthers in the great Hive war and without their help the war might have been lost.</p>

<p>Once safely away from the Time Machine you cut in the Ion Drive and accelerate gradually to Mach 6 with a loud bang as you break the sound barrier. The journey takes just overhalf an hour and you hurtle towards the night sky ahead of you and catch it up. The night is cloudy and dark by the time you have located the city. It is lit by torches and appears to be a strange mixture of golden-roofed palaces, wooden dwellings and magnificent tents, called yurts. You land the flyer at the mouth of a cave near the city, don the disguise of a Mongol warrior (prepared in the Molecular Converter), and take the flyer's Homing Beacon with you. As you slip into the city there are sounds of revelry everywhere. You overhear the whispered conversation between the city gate guards. Through your Translator you make out that the celebrations are due to the miraculous recovery of Ogedai Khan, who had been given up for dead.</p>
<p>Suddenly your Psychic Awareness alerts you. The black disc- like flyer, which you saw earlier, hisses overhead, invisible in the dark night. The Time Lord is returning to Vienna and the Time Machine. In the city, there is a sudden clashing of cymbals and a row of torches is brought out onto a balcony high up on the largest palace. A figure appears, flanked by guards, and you hear the cry, 'Ogedai, Ogedai Khan!', go up from the huge crowd gathered before the palace. If you do not kill Ogedai, Europe will be ravaged by the mongols and civilisation as you know it will never have been. As you draw nearer to the palace you see two guards outside its gate. At close quarters you see that they are short and well-built. Dark, slanted eyes stare out from flat, yellow faces, marked by high cheekbones and small noses with flaring nostrils. The greasy black plaits of one of them are crawling with lice. From their smell you guess they do not wash. Do you:</p>

<p>As you turn towards the hill near Shevardino on which Napoleon has set up his Command Post, a group of horsemen gallops towards you. Marshal Ney, with some of his staff, is intent on forming a plan with Murat to combine the infantry and cavalry in an attack against the Russians in the redoubt who are commanded by Prince Bagration. Marshal Ney, 'bravest of the brave', has a fresh-faced look about him, curly hair and curling side whiskers. As he approaches one of his aides calls his attention to a movement of the Russians. Prince Bagration has ordered an attack. Ney reins in and curses and then sends men galloping in all directions. The speed with which he takes decisions is breath-taking. Soon he finds himself without an aide-de-camp to entrust with his next message and, seeing you in your fine uniform, he beckons you over. Do you:</p>

<p>You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole on Earth, 1241 AD. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and, using your Psychic Awareness, locate the Timehole on Earth 1241. When you have translated this location into co- ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you. You may spend this time in the Autodoc, if you wish and gain up to 12 Endurance points.</p>
<p>The outside camera begins to swivel, showing you the land all around. Behind you is a forest, shrouded in snow, and the hologram generator disguises Falcon's Wing as part of this forest. You are on high ground and to the right you can see a village with a few stone dwellings and many wattle and daub huts, their thatched roofs laden with snow. Ahead, the frosted ground falls away into a wide river valley. The river is frozen over, but you can plainly see its graceful curves stretching to a large walled city a few miles away. Here and there on the plain you can see parties of horsemen riding swiftly. You ask CAIN for some historical information. CAIN responds. 'It is winter, 1241 AD. The city you see is Vienna and the river, the Danube. The mongol horde led by the general, Subatai, has conquered Russia and Poland, and defeated a western army at Liegnitz, before overrunning Hungary. They are a few miles from Vienna, poised to ravage the rest of Europe. Their ruler is Ogedai, son of Genghis Khan. He will die within the next few days and when the news reaches the Golden Horde, they must, under Genghis Khan's code of law, the Yasa, return to the mongol capital, Karakorum, to decide who will succeed him. Vienna will not fall and Europe will be saved.'</p>
<p>You break in, 'And if Ogedai should live?'</p>
<p>CAIN continues, The likelihood is that Europe would be overrun and the Timelines changed beyond recognition. Civilisation would be set back a thousand years.' You decide to investigate the area for signs of another Time Machine and CAIN programmes the Molecular Converter to produce the clothes of a Viennese peasant: a sackcloth tunic, woollen leggings and hooded cloak, which you put on over your uniform. You step out into the fresh clean air. Turn to 381.</p>

<p>You may lie in your Autodoc during the journey and gain up to 12 Endurance points. Falcon's Wing rematerialises at the same instant as Bloodhound's Machine, Hunter. The digital readout shows the date: 7th September, 1812. You are at the edge of some woods and, once again, the hologram generator disguises the machine in the form of a group of fir trees. The outside camera shows an amazing sight: two colourful armies face each other along a line three miles long. It is early morning, but already the battlefield is becoming shrouded in the smoke of a thousand cannon. You ask CAIN for a historical report. CAIN replies, The French Emperor, Napoleon I, has conquered most of Europe and has invaded Russia with a large army. Today, the Russian commander in chief, Kutusov, has decided to give battle, here at Borodino. The French will win a victory, but it will not be the crushing victory that Napoleon needs to force the Russians to give in before the awful Russian winter kills the Frenchmen for them.' Thanking CAIN for his brief history, you ask him what could be done to change the Timelines at this battle. CAIN responds quickly, 'Marshal Ney will win an advantage for the French, but Murat's cavalry fail to exploit this. Napoleon, unwell, will not send in his best troops, the Imperial Guard, to support Ney at the critical moment. If he were persuaded to do so he would win a crushing victory. The same might occur if Murat's cavalry were used to better effect. The Russians would be forced to surrender and Napoleon would remain master of Europe. In this case, Europe would continue to be ravaged by wars for several decades. Countless more people would die and there would be great changes in the year 3033. I do not have enough data to outline these with any great probability of being correct.' You nod and are preparing to leave Falcon's Wing when CAIN chimes again, unbidden, 'You will remember of course, Falcon, that one of your ancestors is an Aide-de-Camp, carrying messages for Marshal Ney.'</p>
<p>'Of course, CAIN,' you smile and ask him to activate the Molecular Converter. CAIN programmes a uniform into the Converter and you are soon dressed in the most stylish uniform imaginable. A short, white jacket, fronted with gold braid, red trousers with a black stripe down the side, a short black cape trimmed with gold, called a Pelisse, and your Psionic Enhancer has become a bearskin helmet with a white plume. Leaving Falcon's Wing, you are amused to see Bloodhound dressed as lavishly as yourself in scarlet and blue. He suggests that you acquire horses and this you manage to do, finding the horses of some French scouts picketed nearby. Bloodhound shows you a map of the battlefield he has had printed by his own version of CAIN. The nearest troops to you are some French and Polish, commanded by the Polish Count, Poniatowski. As you ride towards the battlefield your holo-detector bleeps. There is a Time Machine nearby. Do you:</p>

<p>You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational co-ordinates for the Timehole in Kelados, 2710 AD. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and, using your Psychic Awareness, locate the Timehole at Kelados 2710 AD. When you have translated this location into co-ordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more.

You emerge from the greyness of null-space and, switching on the external cameras, see a huge spaceport on an artificial island, built so that the Keladi could trade with other spacefaring races without forcing them to adapt to an undersea environment. The huge vaulted Starport stretches for miles on each side; you can count more than forty different types of spacefaring vessels. The holo-generator throws the image of a large aluglass container around Falcon's Wing. The camera shows that nobody has noticed its sudden appearance. You ask CAIN for historical details of Kelados in 2710 AD. It chimes, 'At this moment in time the Keladi are on the brink of war with the Earth Federation. Reason: border incidents misinterpreted by the Keladi as being a way of testing their defence systems. The Keladi, at this time, do not realise that many humans break the Earth Federation's laws and suppose that if one human kills a Keladi, his "clan", or all Earthers approve his action. Phocian pirates are being encouraged to use Keladi Starports as bases from which to prey on Earth Federation shipping.'</p>
<p>'What could be done to change the Timeline here?' you interrupt.</p>
<p>CAIN waits for some seconds before replying. 'I can see one method of changing the Timeline which would be both easy to do and disastrous in effect. The Keladi envoy, Korakiik, a telepath, regarded as insane and "clanless" by the Keladi, but the only one who, through his psionic power, understands the Earth Federation and the humans, is shortly due to leave Kelados orbit to meet an Earth envoy. Historically, he was responsible for preventing a war which would probably destroy both civilisations. To prevent this meeting would change the Timeline to a greater degree than I can compute.' You find yourself thanking CAIN as you pull on the uniform of a Phocian pirate which CAIN has already instructed the Molecular Converter to prepare. Your Psionic Enhancer helmet now resembles the helmet of a Phocian laser-turret operator, disguising your features. Taking your holo-detector, you set out in search of Lord Speke. Turn to 360.</p>

<p>Bloodhound suggests that the first move should be to find Napoleon and as you set out with him, towards Napoleon's Command Post at the hamlet of Shevardino, the French troops begin to press home their attack: Davout's infantry, in massed blue columns, storm the redoubt upon which the Russian guns are mounted and Ney prepares to send his troops against the nearby village. Smoke from the guns rolls across the battlefield and the crackle of muskets is incessant. Your fleet horses carry you swiftly towards Napoleon and his staff, who are out of range of the Russian cannon. There are perhaps fifty generals and other staff around the Emperor, many holding spy-glasses to their eyes, the better to follow the course of the battle.

<p>As soon as you arrive back at the Eiger Vault you hand Yelov over to the head of Security and your mission is completed. You return to TIME Headquarters to be debriefed by your new Section Chief, Jobanque. If you did not send Lord Kirik's Machine into null-space, he sends a team to recover it before it can be discovered in 2710 by the Keladi. On your way to your quarters you are told that Agent Lynx has returned safely to the Eiger Vault. CAIN informs you that there are slight changes to the Timelines as a result of your actions in the past, but that these are too minor to concern TIME.</p>
<p>Two days later you stand once more in the Hall of Honours with Bloodhound and Lynx. Lords Silvermane and Pilota sit at the horseshoe table. Lord Speke is not present, having admitted to Jobanque as a result of the interest in his activities your mission has aroused that he has been breaking the First Law of TIME and living as an ancient Greek for sport. Jobanque tells of your heroic valour and the skill with which you guarded history. He has gathered all of the evidence and tells the Lords what has been happening. 'The Hivers had intended to gain power over the Space Federation. They set out to change the past in Kelados but when this was prevented they went back to change the past in two places on Earth, in the hope that at least one would be successful. Straight after your graduation ceremony they examined the chance of using the mongol Golden Horde to set back civilisation on Earth, before travelling to Kelados in 2710 where they hoped to ensure the outbreak of war between Earth and Kelados. Thwarted by you they then travelled to Karakorum in 1241 AD and kept Ogedai Khan alive, using drugs and the Khan's shamans, whom they controlled, mentally. When you killed Ogedai Khan they tried to change history at the battle of Borodino in 1812 and were then pursued to planet Hel where they, or it, died. The Hiver membership of the Federation has been cancelled, of course. We have used the . Mind Probe on Agidy Yelov: he is the traitor working with the Creche who had promised him great power under their rule. As a Siriun, he would have had an excellent chance of surviving a change in Earth's history and the Hivers were to make him Emperor of Earth. He killed Lord Kirik himself, when Kirik began to come close to finding out what was happening. Indeed, Yelov would not have sent Falcon on this mission at all, if I had not received Agent Q's final transmission while Yelov was away, and insisted that he act without delay! Yelov tricked both Bloodhound and Lynx into believing you, Falcon, were the traitor for a while - his deviousness is such that he even tried to convince you that he was loyal to the Federation right at the last moment by turning on the Creche!'</p>
<p>Silvermane shakes his head and says, 'How is it that Yelov ever came to be head of the Special Agents?'</p>
<p>Jobanque shrugs and says, 'He is a deadly combateer and a clever trickster. Only a very evil man could have escaped detection ...'</p>
<p>'And only an agent of Falcon's talents could have defeated both him and the Renegade Lord,' says Pilota and she asks you to step up to her for the presentation of the Golden Wings, the highest honour the Space Federation can give.</p>
<p>Jobanque says, 'I thank you, Falcon, everybody in the Space Federation owes their lives to you.'</p>

Yelov Was a test pilot in the pioneering days of Time Travel; not only is he more experienced than anyone else, he also possesses the cat-like reflexes of the Siriuns. His skill in the Sim-Combat booths is legendary. Behind you the lights of Alpolis stretch for further than the eye can see even though the monorail arcs a thousand feet above the ground.</p>
<p>Less than an hour after leaving Jobanque's office you stand before the huge plasteel hangar doors of the Eiger Vault, set deep in the side of Mount Eiger. Your ID chip is checked and you are mind scanned before access to the vault is allowed by the service computer. As you pass the security droids, you reflect upon the folly of holding Yelov within this tight security net, instead of outside it. He is a million times more dangerous with a Time Machine at his disposal than if he were at large on Earth, 3033 AD. You cross the cavern which houses the Time Machines and the Research Section of TIME. The area in which the machines are kept is partitioned at intervals and you head straight for your own bay. In the centre of the bay, which is lined on three sides with racks carrying maintenance equipment, spare parts, the Variac Drive Recharger and sundry other useful items, lies Falcon's Wing, your Time Machine. You approach the access hatch and the Mind Scanner lights up red, then green. You are drawn up into the Time Machine by invisible Tractor Beams, activated by CAIN. Soon you are standing on the glowing Access Disc and CAIN chimes 'Welcome, Falcon.' Turn to 210.</p>

<p>As you open your mind to the alien you find yourself having to make a great effort to remain sane and regain your human sense of perspective. The Thrix live for millennia on a cold and lifeless world, barren of architecture - they have no need of building, and of almost everything else that you associate with civilisation. You realise that something terrible is happening on this long-peaceful planet and that it wants you to accompany is towards a mining complex which is as alien to the Thrix as it is to you. The Thrix's name translates as Carborundum. Suddenly it lurches and begins to roll across the rocky ground. You decide to follow warily. Turn to 53.</p>

<p>Your aim, though hasty, is true and a sizzling beam of white-hot plasma erupts against the Black Knight. The black armour is ripped open, revealing mechanical gears and electronic circuitry beneath and the droid collapses before exploding loudly. Sir Thomas Chandos and the other knights turn towards you and then begin to run, terrified of your 'sorcery'. With a loud, if muffled, cheer the French knights press onward, scenting victory - your actions have changed the course of the battle and the English are losing. You quickly vapourise the remains of the droid as the tide of battle washes over you, defending yourself from the lances of the French with your shield. Will you:</p>

<p>Your camera scans the gently rolling countryside of mediaeval northern France. Falcon's Wing stands on a hill overlooking a gentle slope on which stands the English army. Descending the hills opposite is the French army which seems about five times as large. It is mid afternoon, but the vanguard of the French army are advancing to the attack, led by six thousand or so mercenary troops, crossbowmen from Genoa, followed by double that number of mounted knights in full plate armour, the flower of chivalry, their shields and banners a glorious riot of colour. Behind these, and still trooping to the battlefield, are countless peasant infantry, some armed with pikes, but many making do with scythes roped to poles. The English army numbers a little over ten thousand men, composed of knights who have dismounted and will fight on foot, brave Welsh spearmen and a large number of longbowmen.</p>
<p>You decide to station yourself amongst the ranks of the English who are divided into three. Nearest to you are the reserves, and CAIN identifies the golden lions and fleur de lis of their leader, King Edward. Before these is another body of knights led by the King's young son, the Black Prince, who is surrounded by veteran knights, one of whom, Sir Thomas Chandos, bears a silver falcon on his red shield. A way to the left lies the third body of knights, lead by William de Bohun, Earl of Northampton, whose blue shield carries three red stars and six golden lions. The men of Northampton and the Black Prince are linked by a line of archers. Where will you position yourself?</p>

Within seconds you flash past it but moments later your microbeam radar picks up a high-energy leading ahead. A large mobile fortress lies in the corridor, an armoured disc bristling with weapon pods and sensor banks. It has two plasma cannon trained on you, several missile bases are tracking you and two energy beam gun turrets are swivelling around.

<p>As you approach the Central Computer Complex, which glows a ghostly luminescent green, in the midst of the dull red expanse of metal, you enter a freak ion storm. CAIN tells you that the ion storm renders his detection scanners useless. If the same is true for the scanners fitted to the wardroids you may be able to fly right into the complex undetected, but you will have to rely on sight alone to navigate. You slow to Mach 4 and dive down into the storm. Just as you begin to pull out, fearing that you may hit the top of a cooling tower or energy pylon, you burst out of the storm.

At three mile intervals around you are what must be planetary defence points: bronze domes bristling with some sort of surface-to-space artillery. Your scanners indicate that nothing lives on this dead world, not even grass, but it is alive with bizarrely-shaped droids which dart and scuttle across its face like insects. You decide to explore on foot and set out towards a building which glows a ghostly green. The bustling machines ignore you until you approach what looks like an enormous spaceship.

You race back to Falcon's Wing but when you re-emerge in the Eiger Vault you are already too late. Wardroids are destroying everything and their Time Machine winks out to load up with reinforcements.

<p>The black Thrix tumbles onward through the yellow gases of its planet, glistening with condensation and reflective particles of dust. You pass the scattered remains of one of its species and you feel the hurt in the mind of the Thrix whom you are following, whose name translates as Carborundum. The grief of the loss of a two thousand-year friendship almost cripples you, but you steel yourself to hold on to your own identity, almost sobbing as you do so. The dead Thrix has been shorn in half by a terrible weapon. There are cavities within its crystal in which still smaller crystal trees grow. You communicate your surprise to Carborundum and he thinks his reaction to you. It seems that he finds your soft bendiness repulsive. 'You should see me without my suit,' you think. As you plod through the heavy gravity there is a slight movement in the heavy air and the fog lifts slightly to reveal the most enormous mechanical contraption, shaped like a long armadillo. Dust rises from its form and it rumbles slowly across the surface of the planet towards you on caterpillar tracks. Its body is composed of overlapping segments of metal like a woodlouse, which glow dully in the weak rays of the Thrixian sun, which barely penetrates the thick atmosphere. Thrix is cold.</p>
<p>Carborundum leads you down into a natural cavern which opens out below the gaping mouth of the mining droid. Two smaller excavation droids are clearing slag from a great conveyor belt which leads back into the belly of the armadillo- like droid. They do not react to you and you notice that their effectiveness is severely impaired by the corrosive gas of this world. They will soon break down completely. As you move towards the conveyor belt you notice another shattered Thrix nearby. Then a hovering wardroid with twin laser cannon sights you. Carborundum begins a high-pitched whining as you blast the wardroid to smithereens. You jump into the mining droid and Carborundum rolls up behind you. Inside the droid is a huge refining plant and in its belly you come to the central processor which controls it. Will you:</p>

<p>Your camera scans the gently rolling countryside of mediaeval northern France. Falcon's Wing stands on a hill overlooking a gentle slope on which stands the English army. Descending the hills opposite is the French Army, which seems about five times as large. It is mid afternoon, but the vanguard of the French army are advancing to the attack, led by six thousand or so mercenary troops, crossbowmen from Genoa, followed by double that number of mounted knights in full plate armour, the flower of chivalry, their shields and banners a glorious riot of colour. Behind these, and still trooping to the battlefield, are countless peasant infantry, some armed with pikes, but many making do with scythes roped to poles. The English army numbers a little over ten thousand men, composed of knights who have dismounted and will fight on foot, brave Welsh spearmen and a large number of longbowmen.</p>
<p>CAIN tells you that if history is unchanged, the quick fire of the English bowmen will be the weapon that wins total victory. If the French were to win the battle CAIN cannot compute a likely outcome but Edward HI, King of England, might be deposed and the Hundred Years War might never be. France would probably grow much stronger than England or Spain. You decide to station yourself amongst the ranks of the English who are divided into three. Nearest to you are the reserves, and CAIN identifies the golden lions and fleur de lis of their leader, King Edward. Before these is another body of knights led by the young King's son, the Black Prince, who is surrounded by veteran knights, one of whom, Sir Thomas Chandos, bears a silver falcon on his red shield. A way to the left lies the third body of knights, lead by William de Bohun, Earl of Northampton, whose blue shield carries three red stars and six golden lions. The men of Northampton and the Black Prince are linked by a line of archers. Where will you position yourself?</p>

<p>You regain the safety of Falcon's Wing, suffering no more than the mockery of some camp followers who think that you are fleeing the battle in fear. CAIN tells you that his scanners registered the fact that the Black Knight was a droid from Mechanon, and that it must have been programmed to kill Sir Thomas Chandos who is probably your ancestor. 'Be careful, Falcon, Yelov is trying to kill you.' If you didn't know that electronic brains are not programmed to register emotion CAIN's tone would have you believe he was worried on your behalf. You can see on the console screen that the battle is continuing. The Black Prince is alive, another horse between his knees, and his standard has been raised once more. The camera zooms in on the leader of yet another French charge. CAIN tells you that the man in the visor-less helmet tied to two other knights who are leading his horse into battle is King John the Blind of Bohemia. Once again the French charge is broken by the English archers and is thrown back. You can see the blind king lying dead on the field, still tied to his brave knights. It is already dusk and the English have almost won the day. There is nothing more for you to do here in Mediaeval France. Turn to 194.</p>

Waiting until you are far enough away from Falcon's Wing to avoid causing exhaust damage, you cut in the Flyer's Ion Drive and accelerate to Mach 3. You curve in a gentle arc towards the fluorescent building and as you pass out from behind a huge iron cooling tower an incredible sight meets your gaze. A spaceship almost as large as one of the generation starships of the 24th century is being dismantled on a huge brass landing field. As you fly over it you see a contraption which can only be an enlarged variac drive being hoisted out of its front end. It takes a few seconds for you to realise what has been happening. The factory droids must have manufactured this colossal Time Machine in hours! Hundreds of them hover about it. They must have planned to invade the Eiger Vault with this machine on Earth, 3033 AD. Now that you have destroyed the Polybdenum and the Timehole on Thrix has closed, Yelov must have altered his plans. As you streak onwards a daunting vista opens up beneath you.

<p>You press the launch button and the launch doors fly apart as you are hurtled out of Falcon's Wing. Waiting until you are far enough away from Falcon's Wing to avoid causing exhaust damage, you cut in the Flyer's Ion Drive and accelerate to Mach 3. The Flyer's instruments indicate that your Ion Drive's exhaust is being tracked and the radar shows three ballistic missiles speeding towards your Time Machine. You avoid them with ease, but two of them score direct hits on Falcon's Wing and a third destroys the mining droid behind it. The Flyer has rocked by the blast. When the cloud of pulverised dust has settled nothing remains of Falcon's Wing. You are trapped time and space on the soul-less factory world of Mechanon with only two days' supply of recyclable oxygen in your Flyer.</p>
<p>Your radar screen picks up another salvo of incoming missiles. You flick the joystick left and backwards but the missiles are: homing in on you. Only a sharp turn at the moment before impact will save you. Make an Evasion Roll but count your Evasion Modifier as zero.</p>

He is in the office of the head of the research section of TIME, Skirrow, the man who, in his younger days as a space rover, discovered Planet Hel and Skirrow's World. He is a stocky man with red gold hair and he welcomes you cordially. You make a full report to Jobanque who nods pensively throughout. Skirrow takes your universal Interface to unscramble the information it now holds. By the time you have finished telling your story of the horrors of Mechanon, a story which Lynx and Bloodhound confirm, Skirrow has returned with a holo-readout. He confers with Jobanque and they swiftly reach agreement as to the next course of action. Skirrow tells you that you have successfully tapped the data-banks of the Command Computer on Mechanon. 'It is named after Zordekai, the Danikoi who designed it. It seems that, since you have stopped Yelov and the wardroids moving through time to attack the Space Federation in 3033 AD, they are planning to attack Earth, using starship droids, in 1986 AD.'</p>
<p>Jobanque says, 'You, and you alone, must stop them before they take off, Falcon. Skirrow will explain why you must go on without support.' You follow Skirrow to the top secret research laboratory, which is in total darkness.</p>

The missiles slam into the cooling tower, demolishing it completely. As you shoot past it towards the building in to which the droid flew, an incredible sight meets your gaze. A spaceship almost as large as one of the generation starships of the 24th century is being dismantled on a huge brass landing field. As you fly over it you see a contraption which can only be an enlarged variac drive being hoisted out of its front end. It takes a few seconds for you to realise what has been happening. The factory droids must have manufactured this colossal Time Machine in hours! Hundreds of them hover about it. They must have planned to invade the Eiger Vault with this machine on Earth, 3033 AD.

It is an ore refining plant and the Polybdenum ore is being fed in at one end and the lumps of reddish rock emerge at the other in the form of sleek rods usable in the Variac Drive of Time Machines. Beyond the refinery is the back end of the armadillo-like mining droid where a conveyor belt moves the rods onto a plasteel rack. Beyond the rack hover two guardian wardroids. A sensor in the mining droid alerts them to your presence and they swoop towards you. The lancing white- hot beam of your blaster ionises the yellow gas, turning it red on its path towards one of the wardroids. You score a direct hit on its power plant and your helmet faceplate turns dark as the lurid explosion lights the interior of the mining droid and debris is hurled through the churning yellow gas of the atmosphere. Carborundum lurches forward, crashing into the second droid, smashing its hover pads and immobilising it. As the wardroid crashes to the ground you see that it is aiming a missile which points at the Thrix.

The gyro stabilisers whine as you use every ounce of performance the Strike Fighter has. The tunnel curves to the left and you bank and turn in an arc.

The droid repair shot's loom towards you and they are protected by a missile launcher which is directed away from you at the hangar. It must be the one that launched the missile the size of your Fighter out of the hangar at you. It is rearmed. The interceptors have lost little time, screaming along behind you as you hurtle over the missile launcher. Your radar tells you that it has launched another missile which is close behind.

You play your blaster's beam across the free-floating oil-discs which you guess control the working memory of the mining droid's electronic brain. The mining operation shuts down immediately. You carry on past the processor into another cavernous space lit dimly by the light of a furnace. It is a refining plant and the Polybdenum ore is being fed in at one end and the lumps of reddish rock emerge at the other in the form of sleek rods, usable in the Variac Drive of a Time Machine. Beyond the refinery is the back end of the armadillo-like mining droid, where a conveyor belt moves the rods onto a plasteel rack. Swooping towards you up the ramp at the back are two wardroids. Carborundum lurches forward, colliding with one. The twenty tons of rock which is the Thrix severely dents the droid. It stops and sinks to the ground but is about to launch a missile at Carborundum.

A copy of CAIN's memory has been installed and linked into our most advanced Battle computer. You have a choice between Zeiss deflector shields or Titanium hull armour.' Skirrow enters the Strike Fighter and explains the controls and capabilities of the craft. She has electronic counter measures, a Variac Drive, four guided missiles with fission warheads, radar and sonic dampers, twin fusion cannons on the upper wing tips, re-entry shields and aft 'point defence' beam lasers. Skirrow continues, 'We have tailored a Startrooper battlesuit to your size, Falcon.

<p>The side of the refinery slopes smoothly to a polished metal droid highway below, like the edge of a bowl. You step over the edge and slide down shooting across the highway at the bottom as if you were on ice. A few worker droids which are using the highway ignore you completely. After about half an hour you emerge from behind a huge iron cooling tower, towards the fluorescent building. You see a large wardroid hovering ahead and duck into a passageway between two large dome-like structures sporting revolving sensor dishes pointed at the stars. You continue along it, skirting the wardroid. When you emerge, you see a massive flat-topped tower ahead. A dark shape appears in the sky and a heavy Interplanetary cargo droid sinks slowly onto the top of the tower, its retros roaring. Your helmet radio picks up a recognition signal from the cargo droid to the tower and you switch your transmitter to record. The cargo droid beams another message to the tower.</p>
<p>There is a deep rumbling sound and the droid is drawn into the tower - its roof is an Access Pad. You transmit the Main Access, Code to CAIN in Falcon's Wing. Note down the number 15 and that you have the Main Access Code. You will be told when you can turn to 15. You turn away and head towards the hangar-like entrance of the fluorescent building. The rim of the hangar boasts twenty great space-artillery pieces like outward pointing teeth in the cavernous maw of a prehistoric monster. As you approach it, skirting a huge iron cooling tower, an incredible sight meets your gaze. A spaceship almost as large as one of the generation starships of the 24th century is being dismantled on a huge brass landing field. As you fly over it you see a contraption which can only be an enlarged Variac Drive being hoisted out of its front end. It takes a few seconds for you to realise what has been happening. The factory droids must have manufactured this colossal Time Machine in hours! Hundreds of them hover about it. They must have planned to invade the Eiger Vault with this machine on Earth, 3033 AD. Now that you have destroyed the Polybdenum and the Timehole on Thrix has closed, Yelov must have altered his plans. As you go onwards, a daunting vista lies ahead. It is Mechanon's space launch field, and it is packed with an interstellar warfleet the size of which defies belief. Row upon row of Interceptors, Ion-drive Battle Cruisers and Atmospheric Fighter-carrying Mother-ships glow a burnished bronze beneath the dull red sky. Turn to 234.</p>

In the wisps of yellow fog he looks like a foul demon from the blackest hell. He shouts, 'I thought I had erased you from existence at the battle of Crecy, Falcon. You've meddled with my plans once again, but you cannot stop me this time, I have the most deadly arsenal the universe will ever know ready to obey my every command. I shall re-program every droid, Falcon, so that your death, which is imminent, will be as slow and painful as the technology of Mechanon can devise.' Just then two wardroids appear above the mining complex and as you look up Yelov draws his blaster. You try desperately to get behind the scarred plasteel loading rack before he kills you, but Yelov is very fast and a superb marksman. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>

<p>The Duke of Alencon comes under your control and his sword sweeps in a great arc towards the Black Knight even as the mace begins to fall on Sir Thomas Chandos. Alencon's sword strikes first and the Black Knight jerks unnaturally, his mace blow shaving Chandos' armour. Sparks fly from the Black Knight's armour as he keels over and his helmet visor clicks open. A beam of red light springs from the open helm and Alencon's armour begins to boil, frying him alive. The light plays on three English men at arms who suffer the same horrible death before your blaster vapourises the robot knight. These strange happenings are too much even for the flower of English chivalry who begin to run. The French knights scent victory and a great roar, muffled by their helmets, swells from the French ranks. You have changed history and the tide of battle is going against the English. Will you:</p>

<p>The Danikoi, a highly intelligent humanoid race, were the first known space travellers. Their civilisation crumbled millennia ago but a small group of Danikoi, realising that their race was doomed, decided to leave a lasting monument to their society.' They built robots which could build and program more robots made from the materials mined on the metal rich world of Mechanon. Mechanon became a single immense factory which lasted long beyond the last visit of a Danikoi spaceship. Unfortunately, the Danikoi had caused the original robots to be programmed to take whatever steps were necessary to ensure that Mechanon remained a lasting testament to the glory of Danikoi technology. The robots of Mechanon sought to assemble space weapons with which they could wipe out all intelligent life, throughout the universe, for there was no other way for them to ensure that Mechanon remained forever.</p>
<p>In 2291 AD, prior to the launch of the roboships, a nuclear disaster reduced the planet to a featureless mass of fused metal and rock. None of the wardroids of Mechanon remained functional.</p>

The ram-fronted hovbike rears and he slips neatly off its back as it roars towards you. A lesser human would have been caught by the hovbike and crushed, but you spin aside and it hurtles past, collapsing into a set of wrought- iron park railings. 'You owe me, mutie upper,' Clone shouts madly. 'Your mindgames have made me a no-life. I've only one thing left, Falcon, I'm not a street'roid any more, I just want to kill you.' A crowd of passers-by gathers and it irritates you that they stare at you as least as much as the outlandishly garbed madman. You decide to drop him, using your powers of Thinkstrike. He crumples senseless to the floor, a look of resigned rage upon his face, and you hand him over to the two Citpol Enforcers who have just arrived on the scene in a jetcopter. They take Clone away, after sedating him, and you walk on into the park. The incident has unnerved you unaccountably and you are unable to relax. Turn to 167.</p>

<p>The wardroid moves faster than you and the beam of its laser cannon knifes into your side, removing an inch of bone and flesh from your hip and thigh. The plasnet of your suit reseals itself automatically, but not before the corrosive yellow gas of the Thrixian atmosphere leaks in and contaminates your wound. Lose 10 Endurance points. If you are still alive, the wound will heal poorly, deduct one from your maximum Endurance forever.

<p>Your power armour battlesuit has been breached and its power plant burns out. You are locked in position like a statue. The suit is too heavy for you to move it using your own strength. Yelov walks slowly up to you grinning evilly and says, 'I said it was kill or be killed, Falcon, and I meant it. I also promised when we met on Thrix that your death would be as lingering and painful as the technology of Mechanon could devise.' Yelov is true to his word. After two years of torture you are utterly insane, no better than a slavering beast. Yelov tires of his sport one day and orders your life-support system to be turned off.</p>

<p>The withering volleys from the English longbowmen take their loll of the valiant French knights again and again. The French knights come on in charge after charge, each time retiring to regroup.As they wait for each attack the English bowmen make a V sign with their fingers, indicating that they are ready with more arrows. From their conversation you can gather that it is the French custom to cut off their fingers with which they draw their bowstrings, if ever they are captured.</p>
<p>At last some of the French knights break through and there is fierce hand-to-hand fighting around the Black Prince's position. The Black Prince's horse is killed under him and he and his banner disappear from sight. A French knight whom you recognise from CAIN's descriptions of coats of arms, a strong fighter it seems, is met by a knight whose name, Sir Thomas Chandos, is called out in a warning by his squire. He is an important French noble, Louis de Nevers, Count of Flanders, whose surcoat is adorned with a rampant black lion. Your Psychic Awareness allows you to pick up a myriad thoughts in the din of battle - fear, pride, blood lust, and, somewhere, a strange blank. Sir Thomas Chandos could be struck dead at any time.

<p>The lasers of two of the interceptor droids play havoc with the control surfaces of your Flyer and you can only switch to reverse thrust as you speed towards the ground, out of control. Sparks fly as you hit the metal floor of the huge complex and the flyer skids at breakneck speed into a bank of machinery. The crash-couch webbing absorbs much of the impact but the whiplash is severe and you have broken a collar bone. Lose 8 Endurance points. If you are still alive, you extricate yourself from the mangled ruin of your Flyer and look around. The interceptors climbed steeply at the last moment to avoid the complex. You have lost them.

<p>You return from the leisure park in time for a thorough rebriefing by section leaders Jobanque and Skirrow, and soon you are settled into the crash-couch of the first ever Weeks/Senior Corporation time travel Strike Fighter. You instruct your new version of CAIN to engage the Variac Drive and set coordinates for Mechanon 1986 AD. All goes grey and insubstantial, but after an hour in null-space you fail to materialise as planned. CAIN reports that there is a time flux disturbance. The droids of Mechanon have constructed a time flux destabiliser, trapping you in null-space! You can dimly see the factory planet below, hazy and insubstantial. CAIN says that you are trapped on a grid on which the timeholes of normal space have been forced into null-space. The Strike Fighter's sensors flash warning red and CAIN reports that the droids have sent five atomic mines equipped with anti-matter drives into the grid, one of which has just appeared in front of you and is hurtling towards you! The anti-matter drive enables the mines to travel across null-space anywhere in the grid of the destabilised field as if they were in real space. However, your Ion Drive will not function here, you can only hop from timehole point to timehole on the grid, instantaneously, using the Variac Drive. Psychic awareness is of no use here, but because of the nature of the field the variac navigational computers will interpret coordinate inputs in the normal way. You must use your Variac Drive to shift to a new timehole point on the grid, as the four other atomic mines diverge towards all of the timehole points. If you don't, the mines will obliterate you. CAIN flashes up a picture of the grid on your face-up display. Which coordinates will you type into the console?</p>

<p>You move quickly out to the back of the mining droid, where the conveyor belt has delivered about a hundred rods of pure Polybdenum onto a plasteel rack. There are no more wardroids to be seen. Three badly corroded loading droids stand motionless, ignoring you. You play your blaster across the rods and they glow red and begin to react with the chlorine in the Thrixian atmosphere, becoming a useless crumbling compound Carborundum thinks into your mind, thanking you for saving its life. He tells you that he was named after a form of carbon because he is considered unusual by the silicon Thrix, but that he is privileged to have contacted so unusual a being as you. He asks if you will become his silica-clone, and as this is apparently a great honour, you accept. Before you ask what a silica-clone is a machine shaped like a flying beetle appears in the yellow mist before you. A red light shines on its belly and a form glides to the ground on a disc of metal. With a shock you realise that it is a huge Time Machine and the form is that of the arch villain Agidy Yelov. A field of orange energy crackles around him. It seems he has stolen the force-field technology of the Creche. He is able to stand unprotected on Thrix, inside the defensive shield. Seeing you and the destroyed Polybdenum he screams with rage. The half of his face which you can see twists in a spasm and his robot arm twitches. In the wisps of yellow fog he looks like a foul demon from the blackest hell. He. shouts, 'I thought I had erased you from existence at the battle of Crecy. Falcon. You've meddled with my plans once again, but you cannot stop me this time, I have the most deadly arsenal the universe will ever know ready to obey my every command. I shall re-program every droid, Falcon, so that your death which is imminent will be as slow and painful as the technology of Mechanon can devise.' Just then two wardroids appear above the mining complex and, as you look up, Yelov draws his blaster. Carborundum sets up a keening wail which seems to disturb Yelov's force shield. He starts to choke as the deadly gas reaches his lungs and, stepping onto the disc, is sucked back up into the Time Machine, which winks out seconds later. Turn to 242.</p>

<p>As the French knights flow past you in pursuit of the English men at arms, hacking at you with their swords as they go, you concentrate your thoughts and hurl blast after blast of mental energy at them even while catching sword blows on your shield. You topple several from the saddle. The impetus of their charge slows and just at the right moment twenty English knights arrive, having been ordered to the Black Prince's position by King Edward when his son and his son's banner had been thrown to the ground. The English rally and after fierce fighting the French are repulsed once more. You regain the safety of Falcon's Wing, suffering no more than the mockery of some camp followers who think that you are fleeing the battle in fear. CAIN tells you that his scanners registered the fact that the Black Knight was a droid from Mechanon, and that it must have been programmed to kill Sir Thomas Chandos who is probably your ancestor. 'Be careful Falcon, Yelov is trying to kill you.' If you didn't know that electronic brains are not programmed to register emotion CAIN's tone would have you believe CAIN was worried on your behalf. You ask CAIN what effect the changes in history will have. CAIN is silent for some seconds before replying, 'King Edward will still take Calais from the French and most of the changes will be cancelled out by the terrible plague called the Black Death that will sweep Europe in two years' time.'</p>
<p>You can see on the console screen that the battle is continuing. The Black Prince is alive, another horse between his knees, and his standard has been raised once more. The camera zooms in on the leader of yet another French charge. CAIN tells you that the man in the visor-less helmet tied to two other knights who are leading his horse into battle is King John the Blind of Bohemia. Once again the French charge is broken by the English archers and is thrown back. You can see the blind king lying dead on the field,still tied to his brave knights. It is already dusk and the English have almost won the day. There is nothing more for you to do here in mediaeval France. Turn to 294.</p>

<p>You shelter under the broken machinery of the worker droid. Pieces clang as they are cut from it to fall to the steel floor by the pulse lasers of the interceptors. They loop the loop and fire again on the return run, before arcing away, their drive reactors emitting a harsh whine. You continue towards the hangar-like entrance of the fluorescent building. The rim of the hangar boasts twenty great space-artillery pieces like outward pointing teeth in the cavernous maw of a prehistoric monster. As you approach it, skirting a huge iron cooling tower, an incredible sight meets your gaze. A spaceship almost as large as one of the generation starships of the 24th Century is being dismantled on a huge brass landing field. As you fly over it you see a contraption which can only be an enlarged Variac Drive being hoisted out of its front end. It takes a few seconds for you to realise what has been happening. The factory droids must have manufactured this colossal Time Machine in hours! Hundreds of them hover about it. They must have planned to invade the EigerVault with this machine on Earth, 3033 AD. Now that you have destroyed the Polybdenum and the Timehole on Thrix has closed, Yelov must have altered his plans. As you streak onwards, a daunting vista opens up beneath you. It is Mechanon's space launch field, and it is packed with an interstellar warfleet the size of which defies belief. Row upon row of Interceptors, Ion-drive Battle Cruisers and Atmospheric fighter-carrying Mother-ships glow a burnished bronze beneath the dull red sky. At the hangar mouth, worker droids are cutting part of the Time Machine apart in a blaze of heat and light. Will you:</p>

It is inhabited by strange intelligent rock-like life forms. Crecy is in Earth's past at the time of a battle- between mediaeval knights in armour which was the first in the Hundred Years War.

The yellow gas turns red in a great cloud around it as the metal of the droid fuses and collapses in on itself, into a molten mass. It carried a radar beacon which has now stopped functioning. You can see four more of the hovering wardroids, one at each corner of the gargantuan mining droid and you realise it will not be long before they register that the droid which attacked you is out of action.

<p>You instruct CAIN to turn on the Variac Drive to shift you into null-space and to re-engage the Drive as soon as you have finished inputting the navigational coordinates for the timehole at Crecy, France, 1346 AD. Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and using your Psychic Awareness locate the timehole at Crecy. When you have translated this location into coordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you.

<p>You fire twice on the run, immobilising one of the wardroids which crashes to the ground, but missing the other. A pulse of energy from the weapon banks of the second droid hurls you against the rocky remains of a dead Thrix. Your suit is ruptured. Lose 10 Endurance points. The wounds will heal badly - subtract 1 from your maximum Endurance points permanently. If you are still alive, you roll aside and blast again. Your aim is true and you have destroyed the other wardroid's hover pads. It falls to the ground with an impact that shakes the rock like an earthquake and explodes scattering lumps of corroded metal everywhere. The immobile wardroid is preparing to open up at you with its laser cannon - you have an instant in which to dodge the beam and destroy the droid. You evade the questing beam of the wardroid's laser cannon and return fire at the immobile death machine.

<p>You regain the safety of Falcon's Wing, suffering no more than the mockery of some camp followers who think that you are fleeing the battle in fear. CAIN tells you that his scanners registered the fact that the Black Knight was a droid from Mechanon, and that it must have been programmed to kill Sir Thomas Chandos who is probably your ancestor. 'Be careful, Falcon, Yelov is trying to kill you.' If you didn't know that electronic brains are not programmed to register emotion, CAIN's tone would have you believe he was worried on your behalf. You can see on the console screen that the English are losing the battle, but it is too late for you to do anything about it. You ask CAIN to evaluate the extent to which history has been changed. CAIN purrs quietly for some moments before reporting that, whilst the Black Prince lives, most of the French leaders have been killed, with the exception of Count Louis de Nevers who will now kill the ancestor of the man who invented the energy deflector shields for Federation warships, at the battle of Poitiers. Note down on your Adventure Sheet that Count Louis survived the battle of Crecy and Zeiss, the inventor of deflector shields, never lived. Luckily, King Edward will still manage to take Calais from the French and the changes of history will largely be cancelled out by the awful plague, the Black Death, that will sweep Europe in two years' time.

You jet away but you are too late. You are caught and held in mid-air by its grav-beam. Once more Yelov displays his skill with the blaster as he aims it at the faceplate of your battlesuit. The high tensile plexiglass is vapourised and Yelov pauses to sneer before doing the same to your face. You have failed.</p>

<p>Falcon's Wing rematerialises on Mechanon, which is a gleaming orb of polished metals. Robo-factories stretch as far as the eye can see, covering every inch of the planet's surface, almost without light in the sombre red sky. At three mile intervals around you are what must be planetary defence points: bronze domes bristling with some sort of surface-to-space artillery. Your scanners indicate that nothing lives on this dead world, not even grass, but it is alive with bizarrely-shaped droids which dart and scuttle across its face like insects. You decide to explore on foot and set out towards a building which glows a ghostly green. You move swiftly but are not far enough from Falcon's Wing to escape the blast of an incoming missile. You are hurled through the air and smash into the base of a huge iron cooling tower as Falcon's Wing is blown to smithereens. As you regain consciousness and realise that you are trapped in time on Mechanon, all goes dark. Your ancestor has been killed at the Battle of Crecy on Earth in 1346 AD. It is as if you had never existed. You have failed.</p>

<p>CAIN replies that the technology possessed by the decadent Danikoi who programmed the self-replicating droids which turned Mechanon into one great factory was at least as advanced as that possessed by a member of the Space Federation in 3033 AD. The fearsome array of space weapons made by these machines is the most deadly arsenal the galaxy has ever seen. This arsenal includes potent nuclear devices, floating fortress platforms and spaceships which are all vast robots. Mechanon is itself heavily defended by Atmospheric Interceptors, intruder detection satellite droids and wardroids with missile or energy weapon strongpoints all over the surface. They are also able to manufacture new droids, weapons, ships etc for any purpose within hours. Turn to 273.</p>

<p>Yelov ducks but the rocket never reaches him. The exhaust from its engine flares brightly but it slows down and is held motionless in mid air. You stare in awe as it is suddenly thrown as if by a giant invisible hand into an energy field where it explodes harmlessly. The raildroid is evidently equipped with a directional gravity beam of enormous power. When the rocket exploded the air behind Yelov rippled like water. You guess that there is an invisible force field which keeps an atmosphere breathable for Yelov in the tunnel which appears to be open to the stars at its end. Will you:</p>

<p>You explain your best guess as to what Yelov is up to and you do not have to wait long for CAIN to reply. After a pause his chimes make a sound almost like a cough and CAIN says, 'My analysis of Yelov's character is that he prefers always to take the initiative and strike first.' You ponder what CAIN may mean by this but when you ask it only replies that it has nothing further to add at this moment. 'I'm only an electronic brain - I can't be expected to know everything.' Where will you set coordinates for?</p>

<p>You arrive back at the point on the grid which corresponds to the timehole on Mechanon as the flare of nuclear explosion glares red on your face-up display at the other points on the grid. The blast at this point has died away but your Strike Fighter's radiation dampers are being steadily overloaded by the fallout from the atomic mine. You must leave the grid somehow, perhaps you can convince CAIN that you are not in the restricted grid of what to a computer is a 'fixed' universe.

<p>A: Agidy Yelov is using the wardroids of Mechanon to build an impregnable fortress on the inhospitable planet Thrix where he can make himself safe from the Space Federation who might be happy to leave him there to rot.</p>
<p>B: Agidy Yelov is moving the wardroids of Mechanon to the planet Thrix before they are destroyed by the nuclear catastrophe on Mechanon where he will hide them until he is ready to attack Earth by moving them into the timehole at the Eiger Vault in 3033 AD.</p>
<p>C: Agidy Yelov has already prevented the nuclear catastrophe on Mechanon and is travelling to Thrix in order to collect enough Polybdenum to ship the deadly arsenal of wardroids through time to attack the Federation.</p>

<p>CAIN is silent for some moments before chiming, There is a correspondence between the names of members of the English nobility who were present at the battle of Crecy and the earliest of your known ancestors, Falcon. Sir Thomas Chandos, whose coat of arms is a silver falcon on a blue background may have been a distant ancestor of yours. I assume you know that a coat of arms is the picture carried on a knight's shield and surcoat in a battle of those times? If Sir Thomas Chandos is murdered before his time, Falcon, you will never have existed.'</p>
<p>Thank you CAIN,' you reply, 'and CAIN, has it ever crossed your memory banks that even you don't know everything? I have the information I need now.'</p>
<p>'If I may be permitted to add something, sir?' There is an almost wheedling note to the chimes of CAIN's voice synthesiser, rather than the usual slightly haughty tone.</p>
<p>'Now what?' you ask.</p>

<p>CAIN responds, 'It is not within the capability of this Strike Fighter to destroy the planet killer. There is only one thing that can be done. You will have to break the First Law of TIME, Falcon. There is a timehole, fifty millennia ago, on Danikos. You must try and change history so that the Danikoi will never build Mechanon. Remember, Falcon, the Danikoi were far more advanced than any other species in the galaxy at that time. You must try to convince them not to allow Earth to be destroyed. You set coordinates for Danikos fifty thousand years ago. Your Strike Fighter has no Autodoc but you have time to dress any wounds you have suffered while you are in the void of null- space.

If your ship defence score is below zero, turn to 90. If you survive, the gyros stabilise the ship and you hurtle downward as the second plasma shell passes overhead and explodes in the tunnel behind you filling it with burning white plasma. You pull up, hugging the ground. The fortress lies directly ahead and three sleek and deadly dart-shaped missiles fly from one of its bases, launch up behind, and dive in unison towards you.

<p>As you have just spent an hour of your life in null-space you may restore up to 12 points of lost Endurance points through the use of your Autodoc. You rematerialise on Mechanon at the same instant that you left Thrix in real time, but as your camera surveys the horizon there is no sign of Yelov or his newly manufactured Time Machine. Mechanon is a gleaming orb of polished metals Robo-factories stretch as far as the eye can see, covering every inch of the planet's surface, almost without light in the sombre red of Mechanon's sky. You have landed on the sloping roof of a refinery and a motionless mining droid overshadows Falcon's Wing. At three mile intervals around you are what must be planetary defence points: bronze domes bristling with some sort of surface-to-space artillery. Between two of these bases is the yawning entrance of a building which is clearly more than a factory. As the camera zooms in, a large flying droid disappears into it, trailing a greenish line of vapour. Your scanners indicate that nothing lives on this dead world, not even grass, but it is alive with bizarrely-shaped droids which fly and scuttle across its face like insects. The sky is laced with power-lines which stretch from pylons atop the factories, and on the towering peak of one of these a radar dish is sweeping in a slow arc towards Falcon's Wing. CAIN tells you Mechanon's atmosphere is harmful to human life and you decide to get into your environment suit again. It also used the molecular converter to create a Universal Interface, saying: 'Insert the Interface into any Central Computer Communications access point and it will extract as much information as it can from Mechanon's Central Computer memory banks about the wardroid's plans, Falcon Good luck!'

<p>The transition into null-space and back again is smooth - too smooth! You miss the slight jar that usually shakes Falcon's Wing as the hydraulic legs adjust to the ground above which you rematerialise. The camera shows a thin mist, then you sit up and stare as a ghostly shape floats upwards past you. It looks like a series of metal girders riveted together with a crude rocket engine welded on at the back. The girders are braced by metal struts atop which a large crystal or faceted boulder rests. Your stomach leaps into your throat - the crude spaceship with its open-to-the-stars construction is not climbing, you are falling through the dense Thrixian atmosphere and you have just seen a Thrixian starship. Your altimeter shows 460 metres and you are gaining speed or accelerating at 10 metres per second from the stationary position in which you were held as you emerged from null-space. You have no retro-rockets - the only way to stop Falcon's Wing plummeting to destruction is to engage the Variac Drive and throw your Time Machine back into null-space and then back into Thrix, 1776 AD. If you get the timing exactly right, you may be able to wink out and return only inches above the surface. When will you instruct CAIN to engage the Variac Drive?</p>

Your scalp tingles slightly as the Time Machine moves out of phase, and everything around you seems grey and insubstantial. You know that should you turn on the outside camera the screen would remain blank, not even blackness exists in null-space. You cast your thoughts into the void and using your Psychic Awareness locate the timehole at Crecy. When you have translated this location into coordinates for CAIN, the Variac Drive engages once more. The process of re-emerging in real time is immediate, but seems to take about an hour for you.

<p>The Disputer turns from you and confers with the others. Some are saying that it will cost them nothing to make a law against the building of a factory planet. Another says that if they are not concerned with the future it doesn't matter if they do anyway This amuses them and they turn to you and say that you can have your wish. A law is typed into the computer as you watch You know that their society can only exist without enforcement and weapons because they never break their laws. You have done all you can and you decide to leave before they think to steal the secret of time travel by examining your Strike Fighter. Turn to 376.</p>

<p>The twin fission beams meet at the point where the weather satellite tumbles gently through space and trigger a chain reaction which sunders the satellite, leaving nothing but the clear emptiness of space behind. The intruder detection satellite has homed in on you and it is guiding three surface-to-space missiles which streak towards you from the dull red world of Mechanon. You decide to use electronic counter measures, hoping to detonate the missiles before they meet you. This calls for precise judgement as you try to calculate their speed and course.

<p>You have timed your fall perfectly. Falcon's Wing settles onto the rocky surface of Thrix with a crunch and a whine from its hydraulic legs. CAIN warns you that the soupy yellow atmosphere of Thrix is highly corrosive and you put on your environment suit. Whilst you are doing so, CAIN gives you some valuable information on the planet and its inhabitants. The flying girders which you passed in the atmosphere were a primitive form of starship powered by chemical rockets like those used on Earth in the 21st and 22nd centuries. The ships are slow but the pilot, a Thrix, has a lifespan of several millenia and being composed almost entirely of glass-like silica can exist in deep space. The rock-like Thrix are telepathic and can move objects by thought alone. They are dormant at deep space temperatures but regain the capacity for thought whenever their ship nears a sun. Less than two thousand remain on their home world - the reason for their decline is not known. Very little is known about their attitude to aliens in 3033 AD, let alone this time. They are not members of the Federation (they will not become members, that is). 'There is one other thing, Falcon - this timehole is deteriorating rapidly and will soon cease to exist. I estimate anything between one and six hours remaining before it fades away. Take care not to get trapped here!' You thank CAIN. The camera shows ghostly outcroppings of jagged rock, swimming in soupy gases. You leave Falcon's Wing - without preparing a disguise (CAIN does not have the relevant information stored in his memory banks in any case) and set out to explore. Before you have gone twenty metres you see a shiny black boulder, faceted like a diamond, but three metres tall. It is a Thrix. Will you:</p>

<p>CAIN selects a simple coat of arms for you, a red chevron on a white background, and prepares a sword, shield and armour in the molecular convertor. You glide to the ground, looking for all the world like an English man-at-arms, and an atmosphere of tense expectancy hits you. As you step away from Falcon's Wing, around which the hologram of a group of trees is projected, battle is about to be joined. The Genoese cross- bowmen are charging towards the Black Prince and his knights. You clank down the slope and take up a position in the rear rank, behind the King, sword at the ready. His advisers are asking him whether they should send help to his young son but he replies, 'Let the boy win his spurs.' The Genoese halt suddenly and let loose a volley of crossbow bolts - the thud of one hitting your shield with great force shocks you as you realise that you could die at any moment. A few of the English fall under the hail of flying steel, but the English longbowmen let loose a volley. The sky is blackened by a great mass of arrows and they fall upon the Genoese in a withering cloud. The Genoese mercenaries must rewind their crossbows before they can fire again, whereas the English archers, tall, deep-chested men, can fire an arrow with deadly precision every six or eight seconds. The Genoese veterans have never faced such a rain of death and they panic and flee within moments. The French knights are so incensed at this that they ride down their own men in their frenzied charge.</p>
<p>All nobles, they treat the Genoese mercenary soldiers with contempt. The charging knights are about to attack the Black Prince's position. Will you:</p>

<p>The computer's tones are calm once more as it says, 'You must leave now, intruder.' Ignoring it, you look around for what may be the computer's core. It is difficult to tell one part of the enormous electronic brain from another so you decide to use your particle disruptor on all of it. As its memory banks are destroyed one by one the computer threatens you that the whole planet will explode, killing you, if you continue. As your beam of destruction creeps towards a large steel pyramid the computer's tone changes to a wheedling whine. 'Cease immediately, intruder, or I shall launch the planet killer at Earth.' Still ignoring it, you play your beam across the pyramid which seems to melt away to nothing as if by magic. Suddenly everything goes haywire. Lights flash everywhere and then dim as the main generators shut down. You manage to find your way back out of the tunnel in the darkness by the searchlight of your battlesuit helmet and climb into your Strike Fighter once more. The sound of distant explosions rocks the tunnel as you climb into your crash-couch. To your relief the ion drives are operational again now that they have cooled down, and you gun the fighter through the blackness of the tunnel, aiming for the white pin pricks of the stars of Mechanon's night sky at its end. There is a blinding flash and the tunnel is filled with light as another immense explosion rocks the complex, and the walls begin to cave in on you.

<p>Your fusion beams blast a hole in the roof of the communications vault and you dive through and into a tunnel about which several inactive worker droids are strewn. An Atmospheric Interceptor screams after you, but you take care of it with your aft lasers. You hurtle out of the tunnel into a far larger one and, banking left, you see the droid repair shops and a missile base. The base tracks you and a missile streaks from it towards you.

<p>The Battle computer locks onto its target and your finger stabs out to the button that launches the fission warhead. It streaks away from you and hammers into the generator with a great roar. The generator is engulfed in flame, however it is not destroyed. A deflector screen glows red, purple and then black around the generator as it tries to withstand the force of the fission warhead.

Perhaps you look like a shooting star to its passengers. Hoping you have escaped notice you follow the capsule into the night side of Earth as its parachute opens, and set the Strike Fighter down in a field. You climb hastily out of your battlesuit and curse once more as you remember the Weeks/Senior Corporation have not yet had time to install a hologram projector or molecular convertor. You ask CAIN's advice and he tells you that you are in Devon, a county in the democratic country of England, and that you might escape serious notice if you pretend to be an American film star in a cinematograph of the far-future, which the people of England would call a science fiction film. You jump down from the Strike Fighter and scan the area with your infra-red goggles. An android, it is too cool to be a human, is moving towards a stream of moving lights, one mile away. You run after him and in the lights, which turn out to be the front searchlights of combustion engined vehicles which roll along a tarmacadam strip, you see that the android looks like a man dressed in clothes from far history.

You leave the trench and walk warily in the direction from which it came. There is a slight movement in the heavy air and the fog lifts slightly to reveal the most enormous mechanical contraption shaped like a long armadillo. Dust rises from its form and it rumbles slowly across the surface of the planet towards you on caterpillar tracks.

<p>CAIN selects a simple coat of arms for you, a red chevron on a white background, and prepares a sword, shield and armour in the molecular convertor. You glide to the ground, looking for all the world like an English man-at-arms, and an atmosphere of tense expectancy hits you. As you step away from Falcon's Wing, around which the hologram of a group of trees is projected, battle is about to be joined. The Genoese crossbowmen are charging towards the Black Prince and his knights. You clank down the slope and take up a position in the rear rank, behind Sir Thomas Chandos, sword at the ready. The Genoese halt suddenly and let loose a volley of crossbow bolts - the thud of one hitting your shield with great force shocks you as you realise that you could die at any moment. A few of the English fall under the hail of flying steel, but the English longbowmen let loose a volley. The sky is blackened by a great mass of arrows and they fall upon the Genoese in a withering cloud. The Genoese mercenaries must rewind their crossbows before they can fire again, whereas the English archers, tall, deep-chested men, can fire an arrow with deadly precision every six or eight seconds. The Genoese veterans have never faced such a rain of death and they panic and flee within moments. The French knights are so incensed at this that they ride down their own men in their frenzied charge. All nobles, they treat the Genoese mercenary soldiers with contempt. The charging knights are about to attack your position. Will you:</p>

It enters an old building which has a painting hanging outside it of two black horses pulling a four wheeled vehicle made of wood. You follow it inside, cautiously, and the building appears to be an ancient form of recreation centre. There are no vid-booths or massage machines but several men and women appear to be drinking enormous glass mugs of what looks faintly like urine. Some of them appear to be losing control.of their limbs. The android is talking to the man who serves the drinks asking in a flat voice for the use of a phone. You can see no holophones but your attention is momentarily distracted as a man staggers towards you and puts his arm on your shoulder. 'What have we got here then? Going to a fancy dress party?'

<p>You concentrate your mind and try to dominate the will of this sentient rock, but its mind is so alien you don't know where to begin. The Thrix is entirely unaffected but it seems to think that you have made a gesture of friendship and it opens its mind more fully to you. Its name translates, in a shortened form, to Carborundum. It clicks at you and your translator tells you that it is beckoning you. Suddenly it lurches and begins to roll across the ground. You decide to follow warily. Turn to 53.</p>

<p>'Ah, Falcon, I was about to call for you. Agidy Yelov escaped from the detention centre nine minutes ago!'</p>
<p>'But that's impossible ...' you begin, until you realise that you have changed history and this is not the same Earth that you left a few hours ago. While you tell Jobanque where you have been he listens in amazement. By convincing the Danikoi never to build Mechanon you have saved Earth and the Space Federation and now it is as if Mechanon had never existed. Even CAIN's data banks have been changed. You are the only one who will ever really know what might have been. Jobanque believes your story and he compliments you on your success.</p>
<p>'No medals this time, Falcon. We would never convince the Federation that your story is true! Sounds like you've had. quite an exciting time! But rest now, take ten days' vacation. I'll arrange a trip to Titan if you like. I'll have to use another agent to track down Yelov (who never died now, of course!). If you go into the recreation centre ask Sparrowhawk to see me. She may know the workings of a fellow Siriun's mind. Happy holiday, Falcon - use it well.' Barely able to adjust to the fact that a part of your life simply never took place as far an your colleagues are concerned, you walk into the recreation centre in a daze. Bloodhound is leaning close to Sparrowhawk who looks troubled. You ask her to report to Jobanque and, as she leaves, Bloodhound asks you how the test flight went.</p>
<p>'What test flight?' you exclaim, and tell him your incredible story.</p>
<p>You cannot tell whether Bloodhound believes you or not he infuriates you, pretending that you are mad, but at last he says, 'Well, you're as sane as the rest of us. Falcon, and I know you would never lie. But if you were changing history, couldn't you have arranged for me to have a solar-racer while you were at it?'</p>
<p>Ignoring Bloodhound's idiocy you protest, 'I have changed history. Why am I the only one to have memories of Mechanon? CAIN was there too.'</p>
<p>'Sounds like a question for the techs to me,'says Bloodhound 'You're a walking time paradox. Ask Skirrow - if he doesn't know, nobody will!' You shrug your shoulders and decide instead to make the most of your trip to the pleasure-dome on Titan.</p>

<p>Soon you are sitting in the familiar confines of Falcon's Wing, running through the systems check and activating CAIN. Immediately its metallic chimes fill the cabin: 'Welcome aboard once again, Falcon. Perhaps on this mission you will not behave in the usual erratic and emotional way common to all organic forms of life!' After threatening to pull the plug on CAIN you ask it if there is any information on offer:'Of course, Falcon, am I not the world's finest computer? In fact, there is some new data from the new Section Chief of the Monitoring Section, PoLing. A disturbance in the timelines has been noted in the timehole currently active in North America, Earth, in the year 1863. There was a civil war in America at that time, Falcon. It is also possible to narrow your search down to only four timeholes. Other agents, mainly on monitoring duties, have found no evidence to suggest there has been any tampering in any of the others,' and CAIN displays the information on the screens. Where will you search for Baal, the so-called DemonLord:</p>

<p>CAIN chimes: 'I have disguised your Time Machine as an adobe house; fortunately no organic life forms were nearby to witness its sudden appearance. We have arrived in Tenochtitlan, the great capital city of the Aztec Empire, Falcon. Its population has been estimated in hundreds of thousands which makes it one of the largest cities in the world at this time. The current 'Uei Tlatoan, or Emperor, is Ahuitzotl, a cruel and vicious tyrant. His son was Moctezuma II, who was Emperor when the Spaniards, along with smallpox, all but wiped out this civilisation and its people. The Aztecs practised a brutal religion, requiring mass human sacrifice, and, after, the consumption of the victim's flesh. Indeed, wars called 'Flowery Wars' were often fought between nations for no reason other than to garner prisoners for sacrifice. Ahuitzotl was responsible for the sacrifice of 20,000 defeated victims in one day, in this very year.' You ask CAIN to run off a suitable set of clothes for you in the Molecular Converter. Soon you are dressed in the clothing of what CAIN tells you is one of the two elite military orders in the Aztec Empire, the Eagle Knights. The other is the Jaguar Knights. You are wearing a fantastic headress of white eagle feathers, a quilted patterned jacket, and a brightly coloured skirt adorned with feathers, with copper anklets and bracelets. Your weapon is a wooden club inlaid with sharp flints of obsidian. You tuck your blaster under the jacket.</p>

<p>You materialise on the world of Dustbowl again. Examining the camera you see that you have not arrived within the domed city of Refuge this time, but at the port, on the edge of the Sea of Dust. This should mean that the priests of Baal will probably be unable to detect your presence. Crates and miscellaneous equipment are stacked nearby and to the left you can see a cluster of buildings. It is day time, and the white sun is directly overhead; the sky is maroon tinged with blue, and the air is filled with clouds of fine dust. Ahead of you stretches an endless red expanse, the Sea of Dust. Behind you and to either side, great rocky cliffs climb high above you, stretching out of sight. Perched somewhere at their top lies the city of Refuge. CAIN runs off the disguise of a Dustbowl whaler in the Molecular Convertor again, along with a filter mask and you step out, detector in hand. You look around, but no one is near. Setting the tripod up, you begin to explore its psychic emanations. You sense that it is registering the presence of a piece of the Rack! Your excitement fades though as you realise that it is lying out at sea, deep in the depths of the crater, buried under tons and tons of dust. It will prove difficult to get hold of. You decide to consult CAIN, and re-enter Falcon's Wing. Turn to 27.</p>

Soldiers stare at you as you run past, thinking you are couriers with urgent messages. Soon you are past Benner's Hill, coming to orderly lines of Confederate men, tired but still alert. Lynx tells you this is Early's division, the Confederate troops nearest to Culp's Hill. You veer away from them, not wishing to draw any enquiries as to where you are going. You see Yelov crossing a small river or brook and disappearing into the woods around Culp's Hill, noticing that he is now in a blue uniform. You move forward towards the wood. Suddenly a line of blue jacketed infantrymen step into the open at the edge of the wood. There is a shouted command and a billowing cloud of smoke appears in front of them, they have unleashed a volley of musket fire at you. Desperately you throw yourself to the ground.

<p>You instruct CAIN to link up with the Eiger Service computer to check for any news. CAIN chimes: 'Incoming holo-message Falcon.'</p>
<p>Agent Bloodhound's face seems to come alive inside Falcon's Wing. He nods a greeting at you: 'On line, Falcon. How's the mission going? A tough one this, eh? Anyway, I have an important message for you. We've picked up some strange disturbances only a quarter of an hour ago in the timelines of the timehole on Dustbowl. I've just returned from a routine check there. Something appeared and then left the Dustbowl timehole within a space of about one hour. It caused a disturbance in the Winds of Time that is completely unlike anything previously recorded and was of great power. Monitoring is sure it was not a Variac Drive emission. It could be Baal. Something else has come up too, Falcon. A new timehole has appeared in the Planet Cave, in 432 AD. As routine, an agent was sent to establish a monitoring device. They sent the new agent, Kingfisher, on this mission, thinking it was a good training run. Unfortunately, he never came back. The young novice has been killed. Also, the present-day Queen of Cave, has asked the TIME executive for help. It seems there have been some disturbances in their past. Someone or something is up to no good there Falcon. Anyway, that's all. I'll hope to see you soon in the Rec Centre. Good luck.'</p>

<p>You set co-ordinates for Dustbowl 2764 AD and instruct CAIN to use the Variac Drive. Moments later your mind is searching through null-space for the psychic pattern that marks the timehole and soon you are guiding the navigational computers to Dustbowl. You rematerialise from the grey nothingness of null-space to a grey expanse of crates, machine tools and rows of indefinable apparatus. The cameras show a large warehouse, dark and gloomy, apparently empty. CAIN tells you that Falcon's Wing is disguised as a set of crates marked 'Eiger Corporation' and proceeds to give you an historical up-date: 'Dustbowl is a completely barren planet, devoid of life except for one spot in the planet's surface, an enormous crater, presumably caused by a huge asteroid. The crater, some 2000 miles in diameter, is able to retain an atmosphere and is filled with extremely fine dust, forming the Sea of Dust. Within the sea, various organic life forms are found. Initially Dustbowl was, not unnaturally, passed over for colonisation. However, in 2631 AD, there was a short internecine struggle within the colony of Ascension. A group of religious fanatics had attempted to overthrow the government. This group was exiled from Ascension, along with many others Ascension saw as undesirable. The exiles came to Dustbowl, the only place they could find, and have been here ever since. The original religion has all but died out by this time, apparently it involved some form of sacrifice. Dustbowl is now a thriving colony. Luckily the exiles found a native organism, the Dustwhale, a great source of income. Not only is its flesh consumed as a great delicacy on other worlds (especially Kelados), it was found that its oil was of vital importance in the manufacture of Anagathics, the life prolonging drugs so common in the Federation of 3033 AD, Falcon. The colony itself is noted for its repressive social laws and is thought by many to be "boring". We are currently in a warehouse in the only city on Dustbowl, called Refuge. The city is high up on the cliffs that surround the crater and is covered in an Environment Dome. People leave the Dome only to sail the Sea of Dust and hunt the whales.' You will have to go outside to set up and use the detector so you ask CAIN to activate the Molecular Convertor. CAIN instructs the Convertor to manufacture the clothes of a typical Dustbowl sailor, a dustwhaler. You emerge into the deserted warehouse clothed in thick, bulky, brown and white cloth, designed to keep out as much dust as possible. Soon you have the tripod in place. The strange luminescent gem begins to glow and you use your Psychic Awareness to explore its psionic emanations. Apparently, no part of the Rack is to be found within the city, but unfortunately Refuge's Environment Dome is preventing the detector from functioning outside the city. With a sigh of resignation you realise that you will have to go out of the city to make absolutely sure Baal has not been here. For this you will need more equipment, and you turn back to Falcon's Wing. The Mind Scanner goes green and you are drawn up into the cabin. Turn to 54.</p>

<p>Taking the detector tripod, you leave Falcon's Wing, and set it up behind a white adobe house that is adorned with many bright flowers.

It is lying in one of the buildings near the Great Pyramid. Putting the tripod back in Falcon's Wing, you head towards the pyramid. As you near it the babble of many voices grows louder. Rounding a large stone building you are presented with an awesome sight. You are at the top of a flight of one of the many stone steps leading down to an enormous plaza, surrounding the Great Pyramid. The plaza is filled with thousands upon thousands, a teeming crowd of Aztecs. Most are dressed simply in feathered shirts or robes, others are dressed richly in brightly patterned robes and headdresses. The stairs that rise up the centre of the bricked pyramid are filled with hundreds of prisoners, almost naked, many covered in white down stuck to their bodies by their own blood. They are formed into a long column marching into the plaza itself. Aztec Eagle Knights, and Jaguar Knights, dressed in the skins of the jaguar from head to foot, are hemming them in. At the top of the pyramid are many black robed priests as well as what must be the Emperor Ahuitzotl, wearing the most incredible finery, with his retinue. The sight of what they are doing fills you with revulsion. Methodically the priests are laying the prisoners on a blood-encrusted stone slab, slashing open their chests with obsidian knives, ripping out their hearts and smearing them over the carved idols of their gods. From what your Translator can pick up, it is a sacrifice to the Sun God, Huitzilopochtli, the Lord of War. Horrified, you make your way through the crowd, towards the building housing the piece of the Rack. It is a low structure, with a large square entrance, hung with bright curtains. Two Jaguar Knights stand guard at either side. Not wishing to waste time in this place of death, you decide to Thinkstrike them in rapid succession. Turn to 311.</p>

<p>Looking at the camera screen you can see that you are on the wharf of some kind of port. Crates and miscellaneous equipment are piled everywhere and the air is almost opaque. It seems to be filled with clouds of very fine dust. The 'sea', you notice with surprise, is in fact a vast expanse of a heaving reddish substance, apparently also of very fine dust. The sun is high in the sky, and is very white. The sky is a misty maroon, tinged with blue at its edges. Behind you and stretching away to either side, fading into the distance, vast rocky cliffs tower high up into the sky, further than you can see. Some way to the left you can make out a cluster of buildings. CAIN tells you that Falcon's Wing is disguised as a set of crates marked 'Eiger Corporation' and proceeds to give you an historical up-date: 'Dustbowl is a completely barren planet, devoid of life except for one spot in the planet's surface, an enormous crater, presumably caused by a huge asteroid.

The only city on Dustbowl, called Refuge, is high up on the cliffs that surround the crater and is covered in an Environment Dome. People leave the Dome only to sail the Sea of Dust and hunt the whales.'You will have to go outside to set up and use the detector so you ask CAIN to activate the Molecular Convertor. CAIN instructs the Convertor to manufacture the clothes of a typical Dustbowl sailor, a dustwhaler. You step out clothed in thick, bulky, brown and white cloth, designed to keep out as much dust as possible. You also have a filter mask, enabling you to breathe in the dustfilled atmosphere here. Soon you have the tripod in place. The strange luminescent gem begins to glow and you use your Psychic Awareness to explore its psionic emanations. You sense that it is registering the presence of a piece of the Rack! Your excitement fades though as you realise that it is lying out at sea, deep in the depths of the crater, buried under tons and tons of dust. It will prove difficult to get hold of. You decide to consult CAIN, and re-enter Falcon's Wing. Turn to 27.</p>

<p>You disappear into the hologram as the bolt of energy explodes behind you, leaving a deep crater in the road. You are drawn up into Falcon's Wing and jump into your crash-couch, setting coordinates for the Eiger Vault as quickly as you can. The cameras show Baal hesitating at your disappearance, but the screens are filled with yellow flame as he blasts Falcon's Wing. The Time Machine shudders as Baal slams into it, howling malevolently, and it crashes onto its side. Your console displays a stream of damage reports, lights flashing and alarms screaming. You shout at CAIN to engage the Variac Drive, hoping it is not damaged, as, to your horror, Baal picks up Falcon's Wing as if it were made of wood and prepares to dash it to the ground.

Looking up over the edge of the long grass, you see the blue-coats stepping back into the woods. The Union have finally occupied Culp's Hill. Suddenly, a section of the woods on the left side of Culp's Hill winks out, Yelov has escaped in his Time Machine. Lynx drops her head in disappointment. 'I'll have to find him again. Thanks anyway, Falcon, let's head back to our Machines.' Slowly, you crawl through the grass until you are behind the Confederate lines. 'Well, good luck, Falcon, I hope to see you soon.

<p>CAIN chimes: There is an incoming report from the Monitoring System, Falcon. A new timehole has appeared in the Planet Cave, in 432 AD. As routine, an agent was sent to establish a monitoring device. They sent the new agent, Kingfisher, on this mission, thinking it was a good training run. Unfortunately, he never came back. The young novice has been killed. Also, the present-day Queen of Cave has asked the TIME executive for help. It seems there have been some disturbances in their past.' Will you:</p>

It set a trap for you and you fell for it. The face inside the powersuit is not Achov's, it is something else, something you are glad not to be able to make out.

<p>You set co-ordinates for South America, Earth, in 1487 AD and soon Falcon's Wing is sailing on the Winds of Time towards its destination. You may lie in your Autodoc during this journey and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance. The cameras show that you have materialised in bright sunshine. You hold your breath in astonishment as the cameras revolve. You are in a great city in the middle of a lake. The shores of the lake are studded with townships, each with a core of brightly painted stone houses, surrounded by smaller white adobe houses. Each township has a tiered, brilliantly painted pyramid rising from it. The city itself is perfectly square, with three causeways leading to the mainland. It seems to have been constructed with great precision. Much of the city is criss-crossed with canals, upon which are moored many canoes. The houses are mostly of adobe, with some of stone, presumably for the rich and powerful, and all are single storey buildings with no windows. You can see the flat roof tops have low tables on them, pottery and the like. But your attention is drawn to the centre of the city. You can see a huge pyramid reaching up over the city. Other large buildings surround it, covered in carved friezes, in a strange, stiff style. The pyramid has a wide flight of steps climbing up its front. You can see figures moving all over it but, strangely, the immediate vicinity seems deserted as do the townships. However, the external microphones are picking up the noise of a huge crowd coming from the main pyramid. Turn to 6.</p>

<p>As you walk onward, in the soft glow of the phosphorescent fungus, the unmistakable sound of battle echoes down the tunnel. Cautiously edging along the side of the corridor you come to a T-junction. Poking your head out you look to the left. A group of yellow and black furred Burrowers are waiting placidly, a mass of mud and rock at their feet. Turning your head to the right, you are greeted by the cause of the sound. The tunnel is filled with two lines of what must be Warriors, some yellow and black, the others with dull red fur, engaged in a vicious death struggle. The Warriors are frightening to look at. They have two arms ending in what can only be described as serrated sword blades, presumably of bone or hardened cartilage. Viciously sharp horns protrude from their domed heads, their elbows and knees. Their feet resemble the claws of a bird, except that they are of sharp cartilage, all talons. Their heads are much the same as the Burrowers, except for the massive fangs. What is most frightening is their speed and ferocity and the feral savagery with which they are ripping each other into shreds. Incredibly swift and powerful, they are creatures bred for one thing only - killing. Behind each rank of Warriors there are two or three Nobles, giving orders. They are human in shape, except for their heads. These are much the same as the Burrowers, except for a membrane covering a circular cavity above the mouth. They communicate by vibrating this membrane to produce sound. Turn to 44.</p>

<p>You set the co-ordinates for North America, Earth 1863 AD, and instruct CAIN to engage the Variac Drive. Moments later your mind is searching through null-space for the psychic pattern that marks the North American timehole. You may lie in your Autodoc and restore up to 12 points of lost Endurance during the journey. You rematerialise on a wooded hill, with good all-round visibility, but your vision is partially obscured by clouds of gunsmoke. To the south is a small town wreathed in smoke. Dense forest lies to the east, another wooded hill rising from it. To the west, you can see a column of men, armed with primitive muskets and dressed virtually in rags, mostly a butternut brown in colour. A few, mainly officers, are wearing grey uniforms. They are marching towards you across a road. The air is filled with the sound of volleys of musket-fire, the boom of cannon and the sound of many men at war. Suddenly a column of men dressed in blue uniforms, stream past your hill, near the town, in what can only be described as an orderly rout. It appears you have arrived in the middle of a battle. You ask CAIN for information. This is the field of Gettysburg, a decisive battle in the American Civil War fought on the eastern edge of North America, Falcon. It was fought over three days, and we have arrived in the late afternoon of the first day. The Civil War was between the Union and the Confederacy, over reasons too detailed to go into here, unless you'd like me to?'</p>
<p>'No, no, CAIN, that's all right,' you interrupt hastily.</p>
<p>'Well, the Confederacy, the men in grey, had the better of the first day, but ultimately they were defeated, despite their brilliant commander. General Robert E. Lee. You have materialised on Benner's Hill. The hill to the south is Culp's Hill and beyond that Cemetery Ridge. The town is, of course, Gettysburg. It would be best to disguise you as a Confederate soldier for the moment. However, the jacket will be reversible, so that the outside is grey, the inside blue, if you should need to change sides in a hurry.'

<p>If you already have a segment of the Rack, you must decide whether or not to take it with you. Taking the detector tripod, you leave Falcon's Wing, and set it up behind a white adobe house that is adorned with many bright flowers. As the white gem begins to glow brightly you explore its psionic emanations with your mind. You find it is registering the presence of a segment of the Rack. It is lying in one of the buildings near the Great Pyramid. Putting the tripod back in Falcon's Wing, you head towards the pyramid. As you near it, the babble of many voices grows louder. Rounding a large stone building you are presented with an awesome sight. You are at the top of a flight of one of the many stone steps leading down to an enormous plaza, surrounding the Great Pyramid. The plaza is filled with thousands upon thousands, a teeming crowd of Aztecs. Most are dressed simply in feathered shirts or robes, others are dressed richly in brightly patterned robes and head-dresses. The stairs that rise up the centre of the bricked pyramid are filled with hundreds of prisoners, almost naked, many covered in white down, stuck to their bodies by their own blood. They are formed into a long column marching into the plaza itself. Aztec Eagle Knights, and Jaguar Knights, dressed in the skins of the jaguar from head to foot, are hemming them in. At the top of the pyramid are many black robed priests as well as what must be the Emperor Ahuitzotl, wearing the most incredible finery, with his retinue. The sight of what they are doing fills you with revulsion. Methodically the priests are laying the prisoners on a blood-encrusted stone slab, slashing open their chests with obsidian knives, ripping out their hearts and smearing them over the carved idols of their gods. From what your Translator can pick up, it is a sacrifice to the Sun God, Huitzilopochtli, the Lord of War. Then your Psychic Awareness picks up a strange psychic disturbance you have never experienced before, something akin to the psychic patterns of null-space. Turn to 125.</p>

<p>Soon you are back in your bay at the Eiger Vault. You put a call through to Jobanque on the holophone, Priority One. He answers immediately: 'Falcon, what news?' You tell him what has happened and what the situation is on Dustbowl. 'Right, I'll authorise the battlesuit,' he says, 'and I'll talk to you soon.' With that he breaks contact. You wait while your polybdenum supply is replenished. Soon Jobanque holophones through. 'Okay, Falcon, Skirrow and I have come up with something. Falcon's Wing will be painted in company colours and made to look like a scientific research diving bell. You can pretend to be a scientist from Earth, sponsored by a fictitious Earth company, say the Eiger Coporation, sent to Dustbowl to research the breeding habits of the Dustwhale. We'll give you forged credentials and money, of course - in this case Dustbowl placs. The battlesuit has been modified for high pressure. You won't be able to see anything down there, but you'll have your microbeam radar, and we've fitted a high resolution graphic delineator. This will analyse the radar reading and render it as a visual graphic on your battlesuit face plate. It'll be just like seeing normally almost. Anything you see won't actually be there, the graphic delineator will just show you what something the radar has picked up looks like. You'll have to use the radar to determine the position of anything. We'll give you some high-tensile wire to lower Falcon's Wing and the like, to make your scientific expedition look convincing. You'll have to go back to Dustbowl and hire a whaling ship and get it to take you out to where the Rack section lies - this kind of expedition was reasonably common in those times. I know this is breaking the First Law of TIME, but under the circumstances, we have no choice. One final thing - Dustbowl in 2764 had a high level of legislation. They were particularly strict on citizens carrying fire arms, especially energy weapons, so be careful with your blaster. That's all. Good luck, Falcon!' Moments later, the battlesuit is delivered to you, along with a selection of equipment, steel lances, rotary drums, a mini-lab and the battlesuit. Maintenance technicians are working frantically on the hull of Falcon's Wing. Painting it in green and gold and adding bits of impressive, but useless, equipment to its hulk. An hour or so later, everything is ready and you fade into null-space, bound for Dustbowl once more. Turn to 48.</p>

<p>You emerge from Providence Airlock and walk into the city of Refuge. Catching a hovbus you head back to the warehouse. A quarter of an hour later, you step off the hovbus near the warehouse. As your foot hits the ground, four black-robed figures, waiting at the entrance to the warehouse, charge at you without hesitation and in silence, drawing long, wickedly curved daggers. You barely have time to act. Instinctively, you hurl yourself, rolling, at their feet, hoping to trip them and run on, to the safety of Falcon's Wing. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>

<p>You move towards the officer and he puts you in the front line, giving you a musket and staring at you suspiciously. Then a man in a smart grey uniform with yellow piping rides up, accompanied by several aides. He seems to be giving orders to the officer. One of the men says: That's Jubal Early, our divisional commander, I betcha we're going in to the attack.' </p>
<p>Then a bugle sounds and the officer shouts, 'Over the wall, men, and at 'em!' A loud cheer goes up, accompanied by a strange whooping and soon you are charging over the wall and into the open. 200 yards ahead is a small river, Union troops are pulling back across it. In front of them are a line of logs, carts and the like, behind which a row of Union troops are waiting. The small river disappears in the heavy wood that blankets Culp's Hill. It is quite exhilarating as you sprint onwards, the men all around you cheering wildly. Then there is a loud crackling sound all along the Union line, as they unleash a volley of musket fire. Men to the left and right of you drop like sacks of coal, but you are pushed on from behind. A little later they open fire again. Make a Chance Roll.</p>

<p>As you watch, the red-furred Nobles begin to fire at the yellow Warriors with small laser pistols, cutting them down in great numbers. This amazes you, as this technology should not be available at this time. One of the yellow-furred Nobles trills at the other and your Translator renders it as: The rebels are breaking through, we must fall back and use the Burrowers, our farms must be protected.' The Nobles run past you to the pack of the Burrowers, trilling orders. The Burrowers begin to work at a rapid pace, sealing off the corridor, whilst the Warriors battle on, mindlessly, until the last falls.</p>
<p>The red-furred Nobles confer amongst themselves. It seems they are going back to fetch Burrowers of their own to force the corridor. Then one of them says, 'We will send the Warriors to secure the outer cavern. May the Baal-Mother triumph.' Your eyes widen in surprise - could Baal be here? Then five Warriors begin to move towards you whilst the rest move back down the corridor. The outer cavern must be the one where Falcon's Wing lies.

<p>You set the co-ordinates for Rigel Prime, 1642 AD and instruct CAIN to use the Variac Drive. Moments later your mind is searching through null-space for the psychic pattern that marks the timehole and soon you are guiding the navigational computers to Rigel Prime. You rematerialise safely and your cameras reveal a strange wooded glade. The sky is a deep yellow colour. The ground is covered in a close knit layer of spongy turquoise grass. There are trees, odd mounds, some two or three feet high, with thick trunks, sprouting heavy branches laden with fat blue leaves. You are in a depression in the ground. The rim of the glade is covered with trees, so that you cannot see beyond it. You ask CAIN for an historical update. It chimes: 'Lord Silvermane of TIME is of course a Rigellian. But Rigel Prime in 1642 AD was a much less civilised place. Technology is low. Politically, the planet is divided into groups of family clans, corresponding to the nations of ancient Earth. The hierarchy of society is almost completely based on a warrior code of physical prowess. Those victorious in combat, male or female, will be the rulers. It is a very violent society. However, sensibly, mass wars are never fought. The concept of the honourable duel is very important to the 17th century Rigellian. Differences between clans are settled in the arena, usually an expanse of land containing many types of terrain in which specially selected teams duel to the death. The atmosphere of Rigel Prime is sufficiently Earth-like for you to breathe, however its gravity is twice that of Earth. I doubt you will be able to withstand the discomfort for long, Falcon. I have disguised Falcon's Wing as a clump of indigenous vegetation.'</p>
<p>'What about a disguise for me, CAIN?' you ask.</p>
<p>'Well, Falcon, due to the enormous size of the Rigellians you will have to masquerade as a child. As you know, Rigellians are blue in colour, but you could pass yourself as an apprentice apothecary or Rigellian medic. They were known to wear masks and to be fully clothed.' Soon you are dressed in bright scarlet and green with a full face helmet upon your head, concealing your features. A long dagger is strapped to your right thigh and a broad, slashing blade hangs at your belt. It seems even Rigellian medics expect to fight. Taking up the tripod detector, you leave Falcon's Wing.

You head for the cluster of buildings to your left. As you approach, you can see a harbour registry office and a Recreation Centre. Moored at the quayside is a whaling ship, all silvered steel from bow to stern. Dustwhalers never paint their ships as the paint is eaten away by the abrasive dust. The ship is long and sleek with three masts, its super resistant sails furled, looking like a 19th Century Earth schooner.

The second day out, you are gazing out across the heaving red sea when you look behind you to see a ring of twenty or more sailors hemming you in, their faces staring mercilessly. The captain steps forward and says: 'You chose the wrong ship, Offworlder. We are all of the old religion, our Lord is he who you would wish to imprison, Baal, Lord of the Flies. He sent word to us of your coming and now we will exact retribution.' He signals to his men and soon you are overpowered. There is nothing you can do against so many.

<p>You walk up the gang plank and onto the main deck of the 'Winged Demon'. A sailor is polishing a huge gun on a swivel mount. It is a rocket powered harpoon gun. His filter mask is painted to resemble an insect's head, and he stares at you dully. You ask for the captain. He stands motionless for a moment and then points down some stairs to a cabin door at the stern of the ship. You go down the steps and knock on the door. 'Enter,'says a gruff voice, and you open the door. It leads into a small cabin lined with charts of the Sea of Dust, with a bunk and a desk. Behind it sits a bearded man in black robes, wearing a yellow headband, presumably denoting his rank, and still wearing a black filter mask. Next to him stands a grizzled old sailor in traditional heavy whaling clothes, also bearded, a long whaler's knife at his side. 'Yes?' says the man behind the desk, eyeing you up and down quizzically. You introduce yourself as Professor Falcon, a scientist sent here by the Eiger Corporation on Earth. You ask if you can hire him and his ship and tell him of your planned expedition. He nods, interested, but when you tell him the co-ordinates you wish to go to he starts and stares at you. Then he says abruptly, 'What do you want to go there for?' his voice muffled by his mask. You tell him about your research into whales and that the area is a prime whale breeding ground. He looks at you and then says, 'Ah, I see,' and nods. 'It'll cost you ten thousand placs, all in. I'm Captain Nathan. Welcome aboard.' There is a knock on the door and a sailor enters.

<p>As you leave the artificial gravity of Falcon's Wing you are instantly struck by the heavy weight of twice the gravity you are used to. It is as if your limbs were made of lead and your breathing is heavy and laboured as you stagger into the cover of some nearby trees, half way up the side of the glade. As if in slow motion you set up the detector tripod. The dull whitish gem begins to radiate a translucent light and you use your Psychic Awareness to explore the psionic emanations of the detector. Within moments you realise that there are no traces of the Rack here on Rigel. As you are packing the detector up, a sound alerts you. Turning, you see a large humanoid figure, seven or eight feet tall, entering the glade. The figure is a Rigellian, obviously dressed for war. He looks much like Lord Silvermane save that his long, shoulder-length hair is jet black. He has blue skin, covered in strange designs painted on in yellow and white. His body is heavily muscled, the legs and arms are like tree trunks, the torso a barrel. In one three-fingered hand he holds an enormous club, a long spiked bar ending in a cluster of sharpened blades. His other arm is armoured from shoulder to hand with spiked steel, ending in a vicious dagger-like blade coming from the top of the wrist. From a wide belt hang several wickedly pointed throwing weapons. The eyes, all white, glare balefully around the glade. You sink slowly into the cover of the trees, hoping not to be spotted. Unfortunately, the Rigellian is now between you and Falcon's Wing. Then there is a sound to your left and another enormous figure, less stocky than the other, but with a hint of tigerish grace, enters the glade. His hair is bluey-green, in one hand he holds what would be to a human a halberd, which serves as a one bladed axe to the Rigellian. In his other hand is one long blade, a hand grip in its middle. His abdomen is covered in linked plates of mail with a spike at the front. Turn to 78.</p>

<p>Quickly, you leave the warehouse, detector tripod in hand, Blaster hidden in the folds of your clothes. You are on a paved street, lined with dark and brooding buildings, all industrial in some way. It is night on Dustbowl. Looking through the transparent Dome of Refuge you see the night sky, scattered with unfamiliar constellations and strange stars. The street seems deserted except for some large automated hovcars that stop at certain points, marked with posts fortunately labelled in Fedspeak. You examine the nearest post. It says 'Refuge Transport Hovbus'. A few moments later a large hovcar hums to a stop beside you and its doors slide open. The computer driver grates, in slightly archaic Fedspeak: 'What is your destination?' You reply that you would like to be taken to see the whaling port and it says 'Providence Airlock, Sir. That will be 130 credits. Please insert your card.'Hoping that CAIN has done its work properly, you pass your credit card through the data processor and sit in the hovbus. The only other passengers are three drunken whalers and a.few other Dustbowlers, dressed in robes of varying dark shades. Soon you are at the Providence Airlock where you hire a filter mask to cover your nose and mouth before stepping into the airlock that leads to the lift, after paying a small toll. Turn to 90.</p>

<p>You walk to the door of the Recreation building and it slides open. Stepping in you find yourself in a small airlock, presumably to minimise the amount of dust getting into the main building. You enter a large room with a bar at one end. The air is free of dust and you remove your filter mask. There are a few people, sailors mostly, eating and drinking in groups at various tables. They look up as you enter and you can hear one or two muttering 'Offworlders'. You walk to the bar intent on asking the barman's advice on finding a whaling ship, when your attention is drawn to a small man, obviously drunk, telling a story to a group of attentive listeners. 'Yup, I served on the Winged Demon on its last voyage and ...'</p>
<p>'What did you want to take up with the likes of them for?' interrupts one of the men at his table.</p>
<p>'I needed a few placs, right. Be quiet and listen up. They needed a few extra whalers for this trip, so me and a few others signed up We sailed out for a day or two but, get this, although several whales were sighted, we didn't do no whaling at all! Then one night, I was woke by a noise on deck. I went up and guess what I saw... ? Well, most of the regular crew was dressed in black robes and they were chanting some weird song. And then, strike me dead if I'm lying, a huge figure, more'n twenty foot tall, bursts up outta the sea. In the ship's lights 1 could see he was as red as dust and his eyes were yellow and unnatural looking.' Some of the men scoff at this, but the small man goes on: 'It's true, honest. He flies, yes flies, up above the ship and there was this awful smile on his face, dust etch my bones, I'll never forget that smile as long as I live, pure evil it was. Well, at this I get off that deck as quick as I can and into my bunk. And that's not the end of it. The next day I could swear there were less of them onboard as when we started out. Anyway, we did do some whaling on the way back, but I can tell you, I'm never working on the Winged Demon no more!'</p>
<p>There is silence around the table for a moment but one of the men says, 'You've been drinking too much as usual,' and they break into uproarious laughter. Turning away, you ask the barman about whaling ships for hire.</p>
<p>'Well, most any whaler is up for hire,' he replies, 'but you gotta be careful. I mean, I wouldn't hire out the Winged Demon, even if it was for nothing. Tell you what though, the Dustskate should be here in a day or two and Captain Cresap Ord's a good man. That's your best bet if you're not in a hurry.' Thanking him, you leave the Recreation Centre.

<p>A hushed silence falls, as Baal hangs there. Then, with a smile of pure evil, Baal gestures at the priests, the passage of his hand leaving a fading trail of crackling yellow energy. They leap up and frantically continue the sacrifice, offering the hearts up to what they believe to be their god. With a thrill of horror, you realise Baal is feeding off the life forces of the victims, using some kind of psychic vampirism. Even as you watch, he seems to grow stronger, raw energy flickering about him in everincreasing intensity. He throws back his head and laughs, a terrible booming sound that echoes around the plaza. If you are carrying a piece of the Rack, turn to 93. If you are not, turn to 111.</p>

<p>The battle continues for a few minutes more. The stocky Rigellian parries an axe cut with his armoured hand and then whips his spiked hand across the other's chest, gashing him. Encouraged, he redoubles his attack but the other twists aside and, his arm a blur, seems to pass the twin-bladed sword across the stocky. Rigellian's thigh, opening up a deep wound. He follows up with a mighty axe blow, and the stocky Rigellian is hurled backwards. Suddenly he disappears into a tree. To your horror you realise he has fallen into the hologram disguising Falcon's Wing! The taller Rigellian stands stock still in utter amazement. You must act quickly. Your Time Machine could be damaged and you must also minimise any effects on Rigellian history its sighting may have. Will you:</p>

<p>A few seconds pass and then there is a ragged cheering, accompanied by a strange whooping from behind you. Popping your head up over the long grass you can see a horde of Confederate Infantry in a full blooded charge at the Union lines. They will pass over you in a few moments. You lie still, pretending to be dead. You can hear the repeated volleys of musketfire from the Union lines and the shrieks of the wounded and dying as the Confederates press home their attack. After they have gone, you risk a look. A brief hand-to-hand struggle ensues and then the blue coats fall back, the Confederates too exhausted to pursue for now. Suddenly, a movement catches your eye and a section of wood just disappears. Your holodetector no longer registers another Time Machine. It looks like Yelov has escaped. You make your way to Benner's Hill where you are pleased to see Lynx waiting for you. 'I stopped his attempt on Ewell, but I couldn't prevent him reaching his Time Machine,' she says despondently. 'I was hoping you'd be there.' You tell Lynx what happened. 'Lucky to be alive, as usual, eh, Falcon? Anyway, I must try to find him again. Thanks and good luck with the Baal mission.'

<p>The lift functions as an Environment Dome, but is completely transparent. You can see out over the Sea of Dust. The sun, bright and very white, is rising over the edge of the cliffs, many miles distant, illuminating the Sea of Dust with silver light. Visibility is not good, the air is filled with fine dust which glitters redly in the sun, but you can still make out the vast expanse of heaving dust, a deep rusty red, almost like a lake of blood, punctuated with small specks of gleaming silver - whaling ships. The lift, actually as large as the warehouse you arrived in, hurtles down at an incredible pace and soon you are on the wharf of the port, breathing through your mask. Several massive whaling ships, of steel from bow to stern, and powered with sails, are berthed. Some are unloading massive crates of whalemeat and oil, others are taking in supplies before going out again. Darting behind a large crate you set up the tripod and begin searching for any signs of the Rack. You find nothing, and, after cursing your wasted journey, head back to the lift. Turn to 40.</p>

<p>An hour passes as you labour on, and the storm lessens a little. Then you come to the top of a gnarled ice ridge, looking down into a valley, where a large grey dome rests. Black smoke seeping out from an exhaust vent is whipped away in the wind. This must be the mining station, and using the tripod again, you are able to tell that the item you seek lies far below it. Then you notice a figure in an industrial powersuit coming around the back of the Dome, making towards the circular air-lock door at its base. The figure sees you and stops in its tracks. The body is in a posture of surprise. Your battlesuit picks up a radio signal from the figure. 'I mean, wow, man, like really ultra! Who are you? I mean, I thought this filthy ice-cube was uninhabited,'and he breaks into laughter. You send a message back, saying you are a Scout whose Explorer Class starship's drive failed.</p>
<p>'Am I glad to see you!' you say. 'I thought I'd never find the mining station.'</p>
<p>'What a story, man. Hey, that's really ultra! You'd better come down, I'll take you to the manager. Ultra warm in the Dome.' You'll have to enter the Dome anyway so you go down and join the man. Minutes later, you are through the Dome's air-lock. The man is stripping off his powersuit, so you do the same, stepping out in your environment suit and hanging your battlesuit next to a row of the powersuits. They are virtually the same as yours save without weaponry, armour, microbeam radar, jetpack and the like. He is a tall, thin man, unshaven and unwashed, characterised by quick nervous movements of his hands. As he leads you down a functional grey corridor, all steel, lined with pipes and illuminated by strip-lights, he says, 'I am Sil McReady, the Engineer, pleased to meet you.' You introduce yourself as Lieutenant Falcon of the Scouts. 'Here's the Rec Room, not what you'd call really ultra but it's better'n stinking ice!' and he opens a door in the right hand wall.

<p>In a flash you have your blaster in your hand. Squeezing the trigger you bathe your assailant in a stream of hot plasma. His dagger stops inches from your side and he is blown back against the wall with a loud crash, sinking to the floor, a charred mess. The other two, screaming loudly, hurl themselves at you. You blast one, burning his leg and are struggling with the other when Cresap Ord bursts in with several men. Your attackers are pulled off. After questioning you, the captain orders them locked in the brig. He asks why you think they attacked you, but you pretend ignorance. He examines you suspiciously for a few seconds and then says, 'Anyway, carrying an energy weapon is illegal. Normally, I'm supposed to arrest you now and return to port, but I need the placs you'll pay me. However, I'll have to take the weapon and hand you over to the authorities when we return. It shouldn't be too bad, you are an Offworlder and you were acting in self-defence.' He holds out his hand and you give him your blaster, realising it would be more trouble than it's worth to refuse it. You have several more in Falcon's Wing anyway. You may note you have a new blaster the next time you are in Falcon's Wing. The captain thanks you and leaves, telling you to lock the door. The rest of the night passes uneventfully.

<p>You point the pencil-like microbeam key at the door and press the button. To your pleasure the door slides silently open, and you step through. Lying on the floor is a translucent white triangle, with three small squares buried at each corner, the Rack section. Grabbing it you turn back to the door. Stepping out into the cavern you see to your consternation that Baal, howling triumphantly, has defeated all of the Caver Warriors and is now turning his attention to you. He points at you and a flare of energy builds up at his fingertips. You are just about to steal yourself to try and avoid the imminent fireball, when the segment of the Rack you have just picked up glows hotly in your hands. Baal snarls angrily as he tries to send lethal energy winging its way towards you across the cavern. He tries again and again, but it seems the piece you have just picked up is preventing him from using his natural energy. He is still deadly, however. Now you will have to try to get to the corridor on the other side of the cavern. As you run out across the rocky floor, he scoops up the grisly remains of a Warrior and readies himself to hurl it at you. You will have to distract Baal in some way. Will you:</p>

<p>Grunting, you force yourself up the side of the glade as it echoes to the ring of steel on steel and the guttural cries of the combatants. Soon, you are at the edge of the glade. You can see that it is part of a large open area, mostly grass, dotted with areas of hilly ground, marsh and forest, all mostly squat and in shades of blue in sharp contrast with the yellow sky. You can just make out some kind of fence or barrier enclosing a few square miles of terrain. It appears you were unlucky enough to materialise in one of the arenas set aside for ritual combat CAIN spoke of. Soon you have worked yourself around to the back of Falcon's Wing. Breathing heavily after the effort of walking in this gravity, you enter the hologram. Falcon's Wing stands undiscovered. You can hear the combat continuing as you approach your Time Machine. Suddenly, there is a meaty crash, a scream of pain cut short, and the stocky Rigellian careers backwards into Falcon's Wing, which shudders with the impact. The Rigellian slumps to the ground, a yellowish fluid seeping from a great wound in its chest. There is dead silence outside the hologram. The other Rigellian must have been shocked at the sight of his enemy seeming to disappear. There is a loud shout and the other Rigellian leaps in, eyes staring in uncertainty, legs braced for attack as he comes to a halt, obviously expecting a trap. He stares at Falcon's Wing for a moment but then sees you, what he believes to be an apprentice medic. Your Universal Translator renders his guttural speech as close as possible into words you can understand as he bellows at you: Treachery! Dishonour upon the Clan Arocks! So "Strong-in-arm-andbody" had an apothecary hidden nearby to help him in battle! I would not have thought it of him. But now your life is forfeit, as is the claim of the Clan Arocks in this matter.'

<p>You continue down the shadowed corridor. After a few minutes it opens out into a large chamber, and to a grisly brutal sight. Large shattered eggs lie everywhere, seeping the glutinous remains of many Cavers, heartlessly killed before hatching. It looks as if an entire batch has been destroyed. It is indeed a bitter internal struggle you think to yourself as you hurry on to a tunnel on the other side of the chamber. This leads to another cavern, obviously a Caver's 'farm'. Several red-furred Workers, ignoring you completely, tend large stone vats filled with decaying organic matter. These Workers are two-armed with large hands. Your stomach turns as you notice the semi-decayed remains of many types of Cavers in the vats. A vast expanse of mushroom-like fungus stretches into the darkness. Workers carrying some of the rotting sludge in stone jars are spreading it over the fungus. The Cavers recycle their dead by feeding them to the fungus, presumably their staple diet. Thankful that you are wearing your environment suit and cannot smell anything, you continue along the tunnel that leads out of the cavern. Turn to 107.</p>

<p>Soon you are sitting in the warmth and safety of Falcon's Wing, glad to be alive after your hair-raising experience. CAIN says: 'I have new information in my databanks, Falcon. It seems the mining station on Chill was the subject of some horrible attack by a particularly unpleasant alien life form. Only Braxton Bragg, the manager, survived. There is a story about a scout, Lieutenant Falcon, who later the scout service denied all knowledge of. Apparently he saved Bragg's life at the end, but was killed himself, although they never found his body.' You explain the recent events to CAIN, and it remarks, 'Baal must have visited this place many millenia ago, and planted the Rack section and the egg to guard it.' As you listen to CAIN, your attention is drawn to a bright white light behind you. Turning your head, you gasp in astonishment. The four triangles have linked together to form a four-pointed star and it is pulsing rapidly with light that is travelling round and round it. Suddenly, Falcon's Wing begins to dematerialise as your Variac Drive begins to function.</p>
<p>'CAIN?' you query.</p>
<p>'I am not activating it, Falcon.' Somehow the Rack of Baal is causing your Machine to travel in time. Your mind is soon tuned to the psychic emanations of the Rack and you are able to determine that you are headed for the timehole in the Dirkheim Void. But there is nothing in the Void, you think to yourself. After a while Falcon's Wing materialises in open space. Your mind reels as you look around, for there is nothing except blackness. Then the cameras reveal a large asteroid hanging in the black nothingness of the Void. A steel door, surrounded by dull glowing lights like the door in the cavern on Cave, is set into the side of the asteroid. 'I would say that the Rack has led us to Baal's base. Falcon. You have to take it in there.'Nodding grimly you don your battlesuit and, taking the Rack in an assistor arm, leave Falcon's Wing and jet towards the doorway.

<p>You edge your way to the left, changing your jacket, and then rise to your feet. Just then you hear a loud cheering and a strange whooping and a horde of Confederate soldiers appear behind you, in a full-blooded charge at the Union lines. Desperately you run forward. Some of the blue coats are shouting: 'Come on, you can make it!' Then an officer shouts, 'Down man!', instructing you to drop. There is a crackling sound along the Union line which is instantly wreathed in smoke, as they unleash a volley of musket fire. The front line of the Confederates stops as if it had run into a brick wall, but the others push on. You are trapped between the volleys of the Union soldiers and the charging infantry, and are forced to crawl forwards. However, the line of Confederates pass over you, and you are bayonetted to death, almost as an afterthought.</p>

<p>The next morning the captain tells you that you have arrived at the area you are looking for. Using the detector, you tell the captain the exact spot where you would like the 'diving bell' lowered. He shrugs his shoulders saying, 'Whatever you like, but I would have thought one place is as good as another on this God-forsaken expanse of dust!' Ignoring the murmured comments of 'Completely mad, these Offworlders', you get into Falcon's Wing and the crew hook it up with steel hausers to a huge drum that will lower the 'diving bell'. Sitting in your crashcouch, you watch through the cameras as you sink into the dust. Soon the screens are completely black, there is absolutely no light and sight is totally useless. Falcon's Wing begins to bob slightly as it goes down. CAIN chimes: 'I think you should know that some life forms can be dangerous here, Falcon. No real research has been done, but it is thought that the creatures of the Sea of Dust use some kind of sonar as their senses. Apparently they emit a light beam of sound which is bounced off objects and the sound reflection is interpreted, like you would interpret light coming into your eyes, Falcon.' With a jarring shudder you hit the bottom. Carefully donning your battlesuit and taking the detector tripod, you descend into the Sea of Dust. You cannot see anything except the battlesuit readout on your face plate. The pressure is great and is almost at the maximum your suit can take. You will have to be quick. Using the tripod you soon have the location of the Rack segment. You engage your microbeam radar and the Rack piece registers as a small blip on your face plate display, only a few yards to your left. Slowly you make your way towards it, the servos of your suit whining under the strain of moving through so much dust. Turn to 174.</p>

<p>Once again, the sound of battle comes to you from up ahead, but on a much larger scale this time. The tunnel opens out into another large chamber. Pausing in the shadows you survey the scene. To your right, two long lines of yellow- and red-furred Warriors are engaged in a devastating struggle to the death. You have appeared behind the red-furred 'rebels', this time commanded by three Nobles. It is apparent that the rebels will triumph again as the red-furred Nobles are equipped with laser pistols and are using them to deadly effect. A reserve of twenty Warriors are waiting behind the three Nobles. Beyond the royalist lines you can see yellow-furred Burrowers widening a tunnel through which more Warriors, these with yellow and red fur, are coming. The loyalists must have launched an attack through a secret tunnelled corridor, but the assault seems doomed to failure, the lasers are taking an awful toll; as fast as the Warriors take up position in the line they are cut down. Looking left away from the carnage, you notice a tunnel leading away, into rebel territory. Will you:</p>

There is a grunt of pain and he throws his head back and staggers like a wounded elephant. The other Rigellian does not hesitate; he twists aside and, his arm a blur, seems to pass the twin-bladed sword across the stocky Rigellian's thigh, opening up a deep wound. He follows up with a mighty axe blow, and the stocky Rigellian is hurled backwards. Suddenly he disappears into a tree. To your horror you realise he has fallen into the hologram disguising Falcon's Wing! The taller Rigellian stands stock still in utter amazement. You must act quickly. Your Time Machine could be damaged and you must also minimise any effects on Rigellian history its sighting may have. Will you:</p>

Its mouthparts are working violently, oozing a vile greyish saliva. Incredibly it speaks, the sound disturbingly unnatural, human words not meant for an alien throat.

<p>Grunting, you force yourself up the side of the glade, and soon you are at its edge. You can see that it is part of a large open area, mostly grass, dotted with areas of hilly ground, marsh and forest, all mostly squat and in shades of blue in sharp contrast with the maroon sky. You can just make out some kind of fence or barrier enclosing a few square miles of terrain. It appears you were unlucky enough to materialise in one of the arenas set aside for the ritual combat CAIN spoke of. Soon you have worked yourself around to the back of Falcon's Wing. Breathing heavily after the effort of walking in this gravity, you enter the hologram. At the base of Falcon's Wing lies the body of the defeated Rigellian, a yellowish fluid seeping from a great wound in its chest. As you approach Falcon's Wing, there is a loud shout and the other Rigellian leaps in, eyes staring in uncertainty, legs braced for attack as he comes to a halt, obviously expecting a trap. He stares at Falcon's Wing for a moment but then sees you, what he believes to be an apprentice medic. Your Universal Translator renders his guttural speech as close as possible into words you can understand as he bellows at you: Treachery! Dishonour upon the Clan Arocks! So "Strong-in-arm-andbody" had an apothecary hidden nearby to help him in battle? I would not have thought it of him. But now your life is forfeit, as is the claim of the Clan Arocks in this matter.' Slowly he raises the axe, almost as large as you. Will you:</p>

Bragg nods tiredly, 'Wellit's sealed in the mine, if it's still alive. All we have to do is wait for the relief ship now.' Suddenly, an alarm bell rings out, echoing around the Dome. 'Somebody has left the outer airlock door open!... It must be Achov! Quick, to the suitroom,' cries Bragg and you run down the corridor. Reaching it you discover that one powersuit is missing and the rest have laser beam holes neatly drilled into their face plates, all useless. However your battlesuit is intact its face plate is of toughened pastiglas, proof against laser fire. 'It's not Achov at all!' says Bragg. 'The creature must have got him, and it's gone outside. There's no telling what damage it can do to the Dome from outside with a laser weapon! Our only chance is for you to go outside and kill it, Lieutenant.

You edge forward to the altar, grab the fourth part of the Rack and dart back to the car. You get it and drive back. You are walking towards the lift when a dull thud comes to your ears from the darkness of an empty titanium container. Suddenly, a formless mass of flesh shoots out of the container, telescoping out towards you, dripping viscous slime and a fetid stench washes over you. Two stalks rupture up out of the mass, black glinting eyes forming that fix their gaze upon you. There is a deafening bubbling hiss, and the rest of the creature, a large mass of writhing tentacles, bursts out of the container. It splits open and a column of flesh rears up, towering above you. At its top rests a hideously twisted human head, McReady's. Then the column splits open with a vile smacking sound and a long snake-like neck comes out, a predatory-looking mouth opening at its end, teeth glistening wetly. Once again you are transfixed with horror, it is as if the creature projected fear in some kind of mental attack. Make a Power of Will Roll as you try to force yourself into action.</p>

<p>A bolt of plasma slams into McReady's leg, smashing him against the door. He howls, an unearthly inhuman sound, and Achov and Bragg lower the weapons that were pointed at you and turn to look at McReady. His eyes roll up into his head. Suddenly a small, suppurating hole appears in his neck, opening and closing spasmodically. His skull splits open with a loud wet crack and something large and bulky shudders forth, forming into a heavy head, horned and armoured, two small pig-like eyes at each side> the whole thing spilling rivulets of reddish mucus. Horrified, Achov and Caleb hesitate. McReady's shoulders split apart and a bony carapace forms over them. Then a thin jet of dirty white liquid hisses from the hole in the neck and streams towards you, Bragg and Achov. Almost as one you duck. Caleb raises the flamethrower, but McReady's side bursts open and a length of ridged, slime-ridden bone shoots out with devastating speed and buries itself in Caleb's chest. He howls in agony as, in front of your eyes, the bone begins to fuse with Caleb, retracting slowly, drawing him to the thing. Achov, Bragg and you open fire in horror, but the creature turns and, putting its head down, smashes through the door and is away, taking Caleb's body with it. Achov and Bragg, thunder-struck, turn to you and apologise for doubting you. Bragg is ashen-faced at the loss of Caleb. Turn to 166.</p>

<p>'I agree,' says Achov. 'Let's do it.'</p>
<p>'Okay,' says Bragg. 'Let's go and get the powersuits, Lieutenant Falcon's battlesuit will be a great asset.' You all leave together, headed for the air-lock strong room. Unfortunately you discover all of the powersuits, including your battlesuit, have had their Central Processing Units ripped out. Achov rifles through the emergency spares box, 'Damn, the spares are gone too!' The suits are useless without their computers to guide them. You won't be able to leave the Dome until you find the suits' computer cartridges.</p>

Lieutenant, you take the centre corridor, but don't descend into the mine itself, that would be too dangerous if it's there. I'll take the left tunnel. Well each take a short range radio on the same frequency. At the first sign of trouble, pull back to the junction and radio for help.' Bragg hands out the radios.</p>
<p>Achov gives you a flamethrower. 'This was Caleb's, he looked after it well. He was a good man, use it to avenge him.'</p>
<p>Bragg says, 'If we don't find it, it'll be in the mine itself. Then we'll go down and flush it out.' As you all head down the corridor you nip into your cabin. Quickly you take out the tripod and search for the Rack. You discover that it has been taken back to the Cavern at the end of the mineshaft.

<p>A bolt of superheated plasma streaks towards Baal, hitting him squarely in the chest. Coruscating streams of plasma crackle and spit across his body and he staggers back in the air, howling like thunder. The crowd back off away from you, and you can hear a muttering of 'Quetzacoatl'. From what you know of Aztec mythology, they think you are a god, Quetzacoatl, the enemy of Huitzilopochtli. This is too much for them and they begin to flee from the plaza in droves, except for the black-robed priests and some of the knights, although they make no attempts to prevent the massed prisoners from running. Then, to your horror, you see that Baal has survived the blast of plasma and is now enraged, snarling in fury.

Luckily, his thought patterns are not unlike a human's, and you catch him completely unawares; to him you are a young Rigellian medic, posing little threat. He falls under your domination. You force him to run away from the glade for as long as you can hold him under your power. He is some miles away when you release him. Soon you are in the crash-couch of Falcon's Wing.

They both collapse into a heap and" you sprint away, losing them amongst the mounds of crates and equipment piled in the wharf. You return to Falcon's Wing where you decide to wait until the Winged Demon has left on another whaling expedition, so you find another ship. You instruct CAIN to disguise Falcon's Wing as a pile of whaling equipment to avoid the prying eyes of anyone in search of the scientist's diving bell. You may lie in your Autodoc if you wish, and gain- up to 6 points of lost Endurance. Turn to 342.</p>

<p>Somehow Baal has detected your presence near the Rack segment. There is a snarl of ferocious rage as he continues his onslaught on the roof. You dash back towards the portal, as bricks and mortar cascade into the room. Before you have reached the doorway, Baal crashes through the roof into the room and comes to his feet on the floor.

You are walking along the wharf when suddenly you are bathed in a mass of bright lights and a voice booms at you through a megaphone, 'Okay Offworlder, lay your energy weapon in front of your feet and lie down. This is the police!' Narrowing your eyes against the glare, you can see a number of figures in red robes covering you with Las-rifles. You realise you have no choice, and you have to surrender. You are booked for murder and for possessing an energy weapon. There is nothing you can do to escape your fate as you are never given an opportunity to use your mental powers.

<p>You take the star-shaped Rack and send it spinning through the air towards Baal. It leaves a shimmering trail of light behind it as it arcs down, whining shrilly. Baal's eyes widen in horror and he screams once more, 'Noooo, not again, please!' Suddenly the Rack splits into four and each section arrows away to fasten at Baal's wrists and ankles. He is powerless as the Rack spreadeagles him, lifting him, cartwheeling around, into the air. The fly creatures halt in mid-air, hovering, unsure without the driving will of their master behind them. Each triangle begins to shimmer and crackle with white light. Then streaks of white lightning flash from triangle to triangle, enmeshing Baal in bands of bright energy. Soon he disappears from view, completely enclosed in a prison of pure elemental energy. Suddenly the whole thing disappears. The fly creatures flutter downward, purposeless. At last you have succeeded, you turn and jet back to Falcon's Wing. You tell CAIN to set co-ordinates for the Eiger Vault in a tired voice, your mission complete. Turn to 420.</p>

<p>You squeeze the trigger and a stream of plasma shoots towards Baal, but suddenly your blaster cuts out. To your horror you realise it has been depleted when you used it to burn a hole through the rock. You will have to do without it until you are in Falcon's Wing when you can fit another energy pack to your blaster. The plasma splashes off Baal's chest but he barely notices it, he hardly even pauses as he hurls the corpse of the Warrior at you with punishing force. Caught off guard the body slams into you, sending you crashing to the ground. Luckily none of its sharp protuberances have cut you, but the impact has cracked one of your ribs.

<p>There is a howl of ferocious rage and bricks and mortar tumble into the room. You dash back to the portal but turn to stare at the sight that greets you. A huge twenty-foot figure has smashed its way through the roof. It is a powerfully muscled man, deep red in colour with slitted reptilian eyes and taloned fingers. A nimbus of yellow energy plays about its form. His weight sets off a trap and a volley of javelins fly from the wall, but they shatter against his skin as if they were made of sand. He hardly notices them. You recognise Baal. You guess he comes here to feed off the life forces of the sacrificial victims of the Aztecs, perhaps even masquerading as one of their gods. He glares at you balefully, his lips drawn back in a snarl of anger. You cannot help but tremble in fright, faced as you are with the primordial evil you can see in his eyes.

<p>You race on through the tunnels of Darkhome, retracing your steps. It is completely deserted, save for the bodies of many Warriors, mostly red-furred, and the oblivious workers still toiling away. You are just leaving the area where you saw the brutal battle between the loyalists and the rebels when you can hear a rushing of wind and the voice of Baal echoing through the tunnels behind you: 'I am coming for you, you little animal, and I shall tear you limb from limb and devour your soul!' Desperately you push yourself on, until you burst into the Cavern housing Falcon's Wing. The Burrowers are still digging. You are almost in your Time Machine when Baal flies into the cave, his bulk filling the tunnel completely, indeed if he could not have flown headfirst, he would not have been able to traverse the corridors of Darkhome at all. He holds a long steel girder in one hand which he hurls at you like a spear, at the instant he spots you. You try to dodge the attack, wishing fervently you had some means with which to combat the super-powerful being. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>

<p>A little later Falcon's Wing is journeying through null-space towards the planet Cave, thousands of years in the past. During the journey you may rest in your Autodoc and regain up to 12 points of lost Endurance. Rematerialising, you look at the camera screens. You are in a large underground cavern of dull grey rock. In places, the rock is lined with seams of some blue mineral. It is lit by a dim green glow, emanating from patches of a phosphorescent mossy fungus, growing around the cavern. At one end you can see a tunnel leading away, at the other you can see twenty or so humanoid figures, apparently excavating the rock. They are short and stocky, with two stumpy legs and four heavily muscled arms. Two of the arms end in massive claws that they use to tear at the rock. The other two arms end in four fingered hands, used to carry the rock away. They have huge eyes, and large ears like that of a bat's. A single nostril lies above a small, lipless mouth. Yellow fur with black stripes covers them from head to foot. They are tearing into the rock with incredible speed and single-mindedness, but seem to you to be unintelligent. You ask CAIN for information. 'Cave in 3033 AD is outside of the Federation, but it is a highly advanced society. Cave is rich in seams of blue magnestite, a natural mineral that acts like magnesium, burning very brightly. It is used by the Federation in Starship drives. However, at this time, Cave is at a stage of development akin to Earth's neolithic age. The planet's barren surface is too hot to bear life and its atmosphere provides no protection from the sun's rays. However, beneath the surface it is a maze of tunnels. Each tunnel complex is ruled by a Mother. The Mother lays eggs in a batch, that hatch into specialised individual organisms, broadly divided into Workers, Warriors and Nobles. Those you can see now are Burrowers, their only function is to build new tunnels. The Nobles are intelligent humanoids, the rest are only intelligent enough to follow orders. There is a strict caste system, like an insect hive, and each batch of eggs usually differ in fur colouring and tend to form into what would be called in Earth terms, tribes or clans. However, each batch owes complete loyalty to the Mother. Different tunnel complexes often make war on each other. The Cavers use sound and smell as their primary senses. Although their eyes are extremely sensitive to light, there simply isn't enough of it to make full use of this sense. We have arrived in the Darkhome tunnel complex, where the Cave of 3033 AD has reported timeline changes. My databanks tell me we have arrived in the middle of a civil war, the only one ever recorded in Cave history. The atmosphere has oxygen in it, Falcon, but with high levels of nitrogen. I'm afraid you will have to use your environment suit, in any case, Cavers do not wear clothing, so the Molecular Convertor cannot help you. Try not to get spotted by any Nobles, Falcon, the response to any nonDarkhome intruder is to attack and destroy at this period in Caver history.' Turn to 18.</p>

<p>His mind falls under your control. You order him to open the door and you step inside. In his hand he holds a thin pen black pencil device. You recognise it as a microbeam key, used to open doors with locks sensitive to a particular microbeam frequency. You take it from him. Note it on your Agent Profile. You are in a small alcove, with a dimly lit corridor leading away from it. You can hear the sounds of rhythmic chanting coming from down the corridor. Forcing the door guard to lead you down the corridor you decide to investigate the chanting. Then, pausing in the shadows at the end of the corridor, you are greeted by a strange sight. Forty to fifty people, all in black robes, are kneeling before some kind of altar upon which is manacled a young man. Beside him stands a tall hawk-faced figure, also in black robes. His hands are raised in supplication skyward, the sleeves of his robe falling to reveal a tattoo on his forearm in the shape of an insect much like the fly of Earth. He holds an obsidian dagger in his hand; it seems some strange religious ceremony is taking place. Then the robed man at the altar, presumably the high priest, screams, 'Come to us, O Servant of Baal,' and with one savage motion plunges the obsidian dagger into the man on the altar and carves out his heart. Then, much . to your surprise, something begins to materialise in the air above the altar. Soon it has resolved itself into what can only be described as a twelve-foot fly, its huge compound eyes glittering malevolently, its black limbs glistening with mucus and lined with cilia. Its mouthparts are working violently, oozing a vile greyish saliva. Everything goes quiet as the fly nestles onto the altar and begins to feed on the sacrificial victim. It extends a long proboscis, inserts it into the body of the victim and, with a disgusting slurping sound, begins to suck up the organic juices. It seems Baal has been here at some point, converting a group of the superstitious dustbowlers to his cause. Turn to 258.</p>

Quickly you say that you heard a strange noise in Achov's room not long ago and thought he was the creature. 'I was watching a horror holo-vid, you idiot' Achov quips.</p>
<p>Then McReady points at you slowly and says: The Lieutenant's the creature. I examined his battlesuit, it's not a scout issue suit, nor did we find any trace of a starship or any drive emission. We would have picked it up on the sensors, normally.'</p>
<p>Bragg says: 'Yes Sil, there was no trace of his starship. He could be the creature.' Caleb backs away from you, readying his flamethrower. Achov draws a short snub pistol, an old bulletthrowing weapon. Sil goes on, 'You turn up from nowhere and all this starts to happen.' His voice is flat and even.</p>

<p>As you sit in your crash-couch, your Psychic Awareness begins to register some kind of psionic phenomena within Falcon's Wing. Turning around you can see that the three pieces of the Rack are glowing brightly, radiating a white light that you cannot look directly into. They begin to pulse faster and faster, emanating waves of psychic energy. Examining these, you are overjoyed to discover that they are transmitting the location of the fourth piece of the Rack. You are forced to break contact hurriedly, however. Being mentally linked to the incomplete Rack is very uncomfortable, its psychic power is rooted in some kind of machinery imbued with an unnatural half-life. The whole feel of the thing is horribly alien. You pause as a wave of nausea passes over you. Then, excitedly, you set co-ordinates for the timehole on planet Chill, in 2985 AD, where the fourth part of the Rack lies.

<p>You walk on up the corridor, further into the Dome, McReady commentating as you go. You pass several doors on the left and right, the crew's cabins. Then he shows you into a brightly lit room with many precision instruments and worktops. A primitive Autodoc lies in one corner. Tsu Tsang is working in there and she nods as you come in. 'This is the lab,' says McReady. 'A really ultra place. Old Tsu is testing a titanium sample no doubt. Bet you're sick of the stuff, eh, Tsu?' Tsu Tsang smiles weakly and works on. Leaving the lab, you are led on down the corridor. It opens out on the right into a large floorspace crammed with industrial machinery, and the corridor continues on beyond it. Then it branches off into three. 'Down there is where we store the titanium. Pretty non-ultra sight,' says McReady, pointing to the left-hand corridor. 'Down to the right are the generators, life support and that. Pretty ultra-less as well. But straight ahead is the Mine Control, ultra man!' and he leads you down it. It opens into a large room, lined with complex instrument banks, computers and so on, making your console in Falcon's Wing look like a toy. In one corner you can see a large personal lift, presumably leading down into the mine itself. Two men are seated at the console boards, running the automated mining operation. 'Our Minetechs,' says McReady. 'Hey guys, meet our newcomer.' They look around, eyes widening in surprise. One of them is a Siriun like Yelov, tall and lithe, with long brown hair and golden cat-like eyes. He carries himself as if he were thoroughly bored with mining. McReady introduces him as Kepy Achov. The other is built like a tank, about seven foot tall, bull-necked and bearded. His name is Caleb. McReady tells you he is from Proxima Centauri, a high gravity planet, which accounts for his size. They ask how you got here and you chat to them for a while, making your story sound convincing. Half an hour later, you are back in your cabin, pondering on how you can get hold of the last piece of the Rack without causing any disturbances in the timelines when you hear a commotion outside.

Unfortunately, you discover all of the powersuits, including your battlesuit, have had their central processing units ripped out.

We'll each take a short range radio on the same frequency. At the first sign of trouble, pull back to the junction and radio for help. Caleb can stay at the junction ready to move to anyone's aid.' Bragg hands out the radios and you are given a flamethrower to use. 'If we don't find it, then it's in the mine itself. We'll all go down then and flush it out.'

Go forth and slay the Time Traveller, for he would destroy you!' This fly being must be an ally of Baal's, in fact your knowledge of ancient Earth history tells you that thousands of years ago a demon known as Baal, Lord of the Flies, was worshipped on Earth. Presumably the altar is some kind of Variac Drive and inter-temporal communication device. Then the fly being appears to stiffen. Its head swivels towards you and your Psychic Awareness tells you that you are being probed mentally. Will you:</p>

Soon your suit coolant begins to circulate as the heat rises dramatically. Your pursuers are slowing, they are not accustomed to such heat, but they are doggedly following. Suddenly you burst out into a dim white light, which seems painfully bright after the gloomy green-tinged blackness of Darkhome. You have emerged into a large natural cavern, silent and undisturbed for centuries judging by the dust. Looking up you see the roof of the cavern, far above. It is cracked and open to the sky in places. Shafts of bright white light trickle down into the blackness below, where it loses its intensity. Particles of dust drift slowly in the light like planets in the vastness of space. Your suit registers high levels of harmful radiation and you move on towards another tunnel that leads out of the cavern. The five Warriors burst in. Immediately, they cover their eyes, obviously in great pain from the light, not only on their eyes, but burning their skin too. Desperately they try to locate the tunnel you are running into, but they cannot. As they blunder about, you rush on.

All around you at ceiling level is a circle of dark niches, their contents indeterminable. There is an echoing roar of rage and you look down. There, seated on an enormous throne, cut from a single gigantic diamond over thirty feet in size, is the powerfully muscled form of Baal. 'Curse you, mortal, will you plague me for ever!' he screams. Then he notices that you are holding the Rack. It is throbbing with an incredibly bright light, so that it is painful to look on. For the first time, you see fear on Baal's face. 'No!' he screams. He tries to hurl a yellow fireball and he tries to exert his mental power, but he cannot do either. Then he tries to fly up to you but he cannot even do that. His face contorts with effort as he tries to travel in time but to no avail. The Rack is preventing all his powers from working. Quickly he bellows, 'Kill him!'

Gasping for breath, the Warriors almost upon you, you realise you won't make it. You'll have to turn and fight. Will you:</p>

<p>You turn your suit volume up to maximum and send out a barrage of radio noise, hoping to 'jam' the creature's sonar.

However, they stop in disbelief when you disappear into the hologram; it looks to them as if you have passed through the wall of a house. Hurriedly, you set course for the Eiger Vault. Then the cameras reveal Baal, recovered, hurtling directly at you and your screens are filled with yellow flame as he unleashes a fireball engulfing Falcon's Wing. You scream at CAIN to engage the Variac Drive and, moments later, you disappear from the city of Tenochtitlan. Safe in the grey nothingness of null-space, you heave a sigh of relief, calming your shattered nerves. Soon you are floating on the Winds of Time headed for the Eiger Vault. You ask CAIN what has happened in the timelines, knowing that the first law of TIME has been broken on Tenochtitlan to an unprecedented degree.

<p>As you continue on, the twisting corridors carry an echo of trilling Noble voices and a much deeper resonant booming trill. Eventually, you come to the end of the tunnel without encountering anything. Hanging back in the shadows of the corridor you are able to survey the scene unseen. It is a large cavern, obviously the centre of the rebel territory. Over a hundred Warriors are standing in a tight block in the centre of the chamber. Burrowers and other Worker types are busying themselves with various tasks, digging, feeding the Warriors and so on. Several Nobles are conferring with the strangest sight of all in the far corner of the cavern. It is a huge pale bulbous mass of blubbery flesh. A small head rests atop the mass. This must be what a Caver Queen looks like. One of the Nobles is speaking: The offensive is going well, Baal-Mother. These devices you have given us,' pointing to a laser pistol, 'will assure our victory. But we are worried, you have not yet laid a Batch, is there something wrong, Mother? We are in need of replacements.'</p>
<p>The huge mass speaks, with the deep resonant sound you heard earlier: 'All in good time, Batch 16-A4-13. All in good time. Just ensure my place as rightful Mother of Darkhome.' Your attention wanders from this conversation when you notice a stack of advanced machinery next to the bloated mass, something that should not be here at this time. You also notice, almost directly opposite you, a huge door, about eighteen feet in height. It is of a shiny metal, and surrounded by domed lights glowing dully. It is jarringly out of place in a culture that has not yet discovered the wheel. As you look at the door you begin to pick up some kind of psionic static from it. After a few minutes' concentration, you are able to tell that the piece of the Rack you are looking for lies behind the door! Do you have a piece of the Rack with small circles at each of its three corners with you? If you do, turn to 391. If you do not, turn to 385.</p>

<p>You can hardly miss such a large target. You pour a sustained blast of superheated plasma into the pale creature and it roars in pain. Then the blubbery mass of the Mother begins to dissolve before your very eyes, seemingly metamorphosing. Seconds later, Baal stands in the Mother's place, bellowing in anger. With a flash of insight, you realise he has been posing as a Cave . Mother using his hallucinatory mind-powers, but your concentrated blast of plasma, whilst it has not harmed him seriously, has prevented him from maintaining the illusion. At this, the Nobles order the Warriors to halt and begin trilling agitatedly amongst themselves. They know they have been tricked into rebelling against their rightful Mother and they see Baal as an intruder now. Taking this opportunity, you sprint for the door. However, Baal, furious, screams, 'You have meddled in my plans too often, mortal. Your puny little organisation can never hope to defeat me, Baal, the Lord of Flies!' and the sound echoes around the chamber so that you can almost feel the floor reverberating. Then he points at you, and a yellow bolt of energy forks from his finger, crackling through the air toward you. You must try to dodge the attack. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>

Suddenly, something sweeps across your legs, knocking you to the ground. Looking around, you see a set of several long human like arms, charred and burnt, heaving a bloated body out from under the lift. It had been clinging to the bottom of the lift. A crocodile head, jaws snapping, rears up above you, dripping slimy juices. Caleb rushes in and sprays it with flame, giving you time to scramble away. But then another spear of sharpened bone lashes out from the creature, even as it burns. Caleb is too slow to avoid it and it buries itself in his head, killing him instantly. The bony spear detaches itself from the flaming mass and begins to disappear into Caleb's body, transforming it. Quickly you use your flamethrower.

<p>You can feel that parts of the Rack are growing hot. Examining them, you can see they are pulsing with white light, reacting to the presence of Baal. Then you can feel an incredibly powerful malevolent will, the mind of Baal, invading your mind. You cannot stand against such force you realise. Baal smiles evilly. But then the Rack segments begin to pulse faster and the power of Baal's will lessens. His smile fades and he struggles to seize your mind. His attack continues to fade, until you see him struggling to use his mind powers, his face contorted with rage. He bellows, 'So, you have half of the Rack! But now I will end your petty existence, mortal.' His voice reverberates around the room, almost deafening you. You realise that the two parts of the Rack, acting together, are preventing him from using his psychic power! He screams in rage, then he points at you and a crackling ball of yellow energy explodes from his hand and burns towards you. Thunderstruck by such natural power, you hurl yourself out of the door in an attempt to avoid the fireball. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>

No one notices their fate and you dash through the curtained doorway into a bewildering mass of corridors and large storerooms containing stocks of maize, sculpted gold and so on. Eventually you come to a wide corridor, lined with friezes, depicting scenes of Aztec mythology. At its end is a richly decorated portal leading into a large room. When you are nearer, you can see a large altar at the end of the room. Upon it lies a translucent white triangle, small circles embedded in each corner, giving off a bright white radiance. It is a segment of the Rack. In between you and the altar, the floor is a checkerboard of nine, six-foot-square stone slabs, laid out in a square. Directly ahead of you lies the first three.Will you:</p>

Concentrating hard you repeat the process several times. Your pursuers come to a halt, almost as one. Some lie unconscious, others are holding their heads. Passerbys stare in horror and then hurry on. You can hear your pursuers muttering amongst themselves about 'sorcery' and 'magic'. They are a superstitious group and they seem disinclined to chase you after your display of power. Indeed some of them, unsure as to whether their prone comrades are still alive, are beginning to scuttle away. Seizing your chance, you run onwards and they are soon lost to sight. Moments later you are back in the warehouse containing Falcon's Wing, running to the crates marked 'Eiger Corporation'. Have you seen a man with a tattoo on his forearm here on Dustbowl?</p>

<p>You manage to control the Nobles. Instantly you force them to order the Warriors to stop their charge. Then they turn and fire their laser-pistols at the Baal-Mother, who is shouting in rage. It writhes in pain as you force the Nobles to keep up their lancing fire. Then the blubbery mass of the Mother begins to dissolve before your very eyes, seemingly metamorphosing. Seconds later, Baal stands in the Mother's place, bellowing in anger. With a flash of insight, you realise he has been posing as a Cave Mother using his hallucinatory mind-powers, but the needlelike pulses of the Noble's lasers, whilst not harming him seriously, have shaken him, preventing him from maintaining the illusion. Taking this opportunity, you release the Nobles and sprint for the door. The Nobles stare at Baal and begin trilling agitatedly amongst themselves. They know they have been tricked into rebelling against their rightful Mother and they see Baal as an intruder now. However, Baal, furious, screams, 'You have meddled in my plans too often, mortal. Your puny little organisation can never hope to defeat me, Baal, the Lord of Flies!' and the sound echoes around the chamber so that you can almost feel the floor reverberating. Then he points at you, and a yellow bolt of energy forks from his finger, crackling through the air towards you. You must try to dodge the attack. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>

<p>When you rematerialise, all the camera reveals is a dirty white expanse, tinged with pink, visibility is almost zero. You have arrived in a storm and sheets of hail are driving against your Time Machine, clattering against the hardened hull. You ask CAIN for information on Chill in 2985. 'Well, Falcon, the planet Chill is a ball of rock rich in minerals covered in a crust of ice. It is one of the coldest planets man has yet discovered. It is devoid of life and the atmosphere is ammonia based. However, at this time, only forty years ago from our time, there is a small mining station, mostly automated, run by a crew of five men. They are working a rich bed of titanium, used in many starship hulls. Incidentally Falcon, the Manager, Braxton Bragg, was a good friend of your grandfather's, your grandmother was Bragg's sister, so be careful. You will have to wear the battlesuit, your environment suit will not be enough to keep out the cold, Falcon. I will run up some stencils in the Molecular Convertor, you can paint on the insignia of the Federation Planetary Exploration Scouts. If you should run across the miners, you can pretend to a be a shipwrecked scout, crash-landed on Chill. Remember, Time Travel won't be discovered for another thirty years.' Thank you CAIN,' you reply. When you are ready you step out into the freezing atmosphere of Chill. Looking around, you can see a rugged landscape of twisted ice ridges and valleys. Setting the Rack detector, you soon discover the location of the last piece of the Rack. With the other three pieces of the Rack in your battlesuit utility containers, you set off towards it. The buffeting cross winds caused by the storm are too strong for you to use your jets, but you take great leaping strides, your battlesuit servos whining. Hailstones as large as your fist are battering against your armour and your instrument readout tells you that the suit is working overtime to ward off the deadly cold. Turn to 94.</p>

You return to Falcon's Wing where you decide to wait until the Winged Demon has left on another whaling expedition, so you can find another ship.

In the Rec Room, Braxton says, 'We'll have to devise some means of testing that we're all human.' The door opens and Achov comes in, wheeling a trolley carrying five gastanks with tube-like extensions, the flamethrowers. One of them is painted red and blue.</p>
<p>Caleb rises to his feet and takes it. 'My thrower,' he says. A few minutes later, McReady enters the room, standing near the door.</p>
<p>'Well?' Braxton asks impatiently.</p>
<p>'It has been smashed, the deep space radio, everything gone. The creature got to it already,' he says, his voice deadpan and toneless as he stands, completely still, gazing placidly at Bragg. There is silence in the room. Braxton is deep in thought, Caleb polishes his flamethrower, Achov stares at the floor, his fingers drumming rhythmically on the table, and McReady stands unmoving at the door, his face a blank.

<p>The blaster is pointing straight at you, but you recognise the face of Agent Lynx. She says, 'Falcon! What are you doing here?' You move closer and tell her of your mission and then ask her what she is up to. 'Well, Falcon, as you know, Jobanque assigned me to trace Yelov. I've found him. He's about forty yards down the hill behind that clump of trees. I have him pinned down. With your help, we can almost certainly get him. You could walk around behind him.' It still disturbs you to think of Yelov as alive. As far as your memory is concerned, you saw him die by your hand, but you also know that never happened, due to a time paradox. Before you or Lynx can act, there is a sudden barrage of explosions. The Union or the Confederates are shelling Benner's Hill. You crouch low and then the tree you are sheltering behind is vaporised by a bolt of plasma and you are both forced to throw yourself to the ground. You can see Yelov taking this opportunity to escape. He, too, is dressed in grey. Lynx looks disappointed. 'Blast it, Falcon, we had him! Falcon, listen, I know your mission is important, but I could use your help here. It'll probably only be for a couple of hours. How about it?' Will you:</p>

The tentacles round your thigh, reel you in, you are clasped to its torso and you arm is bitten off by the gaping maw.

<p>'What in the galaxy was that thing?' says McReady. Caleb points to an insignia still visible on the clothing sticking to the burning mass. In an incredulous tone, he says, 'It was Tsu Tsang,' you say breathlessly, explaining what had happened to her. 'Whatever it was in the egg must have been still alive somehow.' They are stunned into silence for a moment.</p>
<p>Bragg says, 'It must be able to replicate the genetic pattern of whatever it absorbs, mimicking its victim precisely. It can change its form at will, obviously, and it can act in separate units, judging by the severed leg. Presumably its cells can reproduce themselves at an alarming rate.' He pauses for a moment. 'That means it or other parts of it could still be alive, somewhere. In fact it could even be one of us, it's had plenty of time to absorb and duplicate somebody since we've been asleep.'</p>
<p>'Oh wow, man,' whimpers McReady, his eyes darting from face to face, Achov's brow furrows, his yellow eyes narrowing.</p>
<p>Caleb grunts, 'Not Lieutenant Falcon anyway,' he says. 'It just tried to kill him.' The flames begin to peter out, leaving charred remains.</p>
<p>'At least we know it can be killed with fire,' says Bragg. 'Right, everyone into the Rec Room, let's get out of this stinking hole,' and he turns to McReady. 'Go to the radio room and contact the communication satellite, tell 'em to get some troopers down here and a relief ship, fast! Achov, go to stores and get the flamethrowers we use for clearing ice off the Dome. See you in the Rec Room in a few minutes.' Turn to 355.</p>

<p>The Rec Room is where the crew eat, rest and play. Several vidbooths line one wall as does a large nutritional dispenser. Various personal effects and pieces of machinery lie haphazardly about. A holo-viewer is on hold, the small projected figures frozen in place - it looks like some kind of horror-holo feature, possibly a holo-nasty. The machine is labelled 'Kepy Achov's - keep off!'. Absently, you note that the holo-cassette is called 'Night of the Star-Vampires'. Two people, one an oriental of slim build, with the insignia of a medtech on her overalls, the other a heavily built, neat looking man, with a carefully trimmed beard and thick black hair are seated at a long table. They look up in astonishment at the sight of you, they probably haven't seen another human face for weeks. You tell them your story and the bearded man says, 'I see. You're lucky to have survived. I'm Braxton Bragg, the manager, you can call me Brax. This is Tsu Tsang, our Medic and general boffin,' and he indicates the oriental woman next to him. 'It looks like you'll be stuck here until the Relief Ship arrives, I'm afraid. That will be about two weeks from now. It'll cost too much to send a starship just for you! Tsu Tsang will show you your cabin and then you can come back here. We haven't spoken to anyone else for two months you'll be a welcome change,' and he smiles warmly at you.</p>
<p>Tsu Tsang walks over to you, and you notice she is limping. She says tersely, 'Drill bit fell on my foot two weeks ago, broke it badly.' She shows you into a tiny cabin with a single bunk, a few doors on from the Rec Room. It is opposite a large room. 'Make yourself at home,' she says wryly and leaves. A minute later, there is a knock at the door and Sil McReady comes in.' Hi, Brax asked me to show you around if you'd like? Its a pretty ultra place, or it was at first! I'm getting ultra sick of it now.' You decide to agree as you'll need to find out if the Rack is near, despite having to listen to McReady's obsessive use of the word 'ultra'. Turn to 244.</p>

Suddenly you burst out into a dim white light, which seems painfully bright after the gloomy green-tinged blackness of Darkhome. You have emerged into a large natural cavern, silent and undisturbed for centuries judging by the dust. Looking up you see the roof of the cavern, far above. It is cracked and open to the sky in places. Shafts of bright white light trickle down into the blackness below, where it loses its intensity. Particles of dust drift slowly in the light like planets in the vastness of space.

<p>Looking out, you can see Caleb and Achov running into the Rec Room and you follow them in. There is an air of excitement, as Achov speaks rapidly. 'Brax, the Autodrill has uncovered a large cavern, deep in the rock. I've never seen anything like it. We went down and had a look, we found these.' And he puts two objects onto the table. One is a strange leathery egg, about the size of a football. The other sends a rush of adrenalin through your blood - it is the final piece of the Rack. 'Not only that, there is a circular shaft leading from the cavern roof right up through a mile of rock, up to the ice. Can't be natural. Looks like it's some remains of the Ancient's culture, the Federation'll pay through the nose to examine it. We're as good as rich.'</p>
<p>Braxton Bragg looks at them thoughtfully. 'You could be right Achov, this egg could be a real find; bit weird though, isn't it?'</p>
<p>'Yeah, really ultra, man,' McReady chips in to be answered by several irritated glares.</p>
<p>'We'll get Tsu Tsang to examine it.' Braxton Bragg continues. 'Here, Achov, take it to her, and then get back to work, the Mining Company doesn't pay you to sit around!' He laughs. When they have gone, Braxton eyes you speculatively, Tunny a Fed Scout should turn up at the same time as we find this, eh?'</p>
<p>'Yes, an amazing coincidence, isn't it,' you reply and he smiles. You decide to return to your cabin and wait for night to fall and the crew to sleep. Then you can creep into the lab, take the Rack and leave, they'll think it's all some secret government operation. At any rate, it seems Baal is not here in person, as on Cave and Tenochtitlan.

<p>'Okay Lynx, I'll help. What do you think he's up to?'</p>
<p>Thanks Falcon, I can certainly use it! Well, at the moment, Yelov just seems to be trying to avoid being caught, but there is one thing he could do here today. The Union forces are pretty demoralised at the moment. In about an hour General Lee will order General Ewell, the commander of the Confederate forces on this flank, to launch an attack, if possible. Culp's Hill is unoccupied at the moment, it will be held by Union troops later, but if Ewell was to take it now... Historically, Ewell decided not to attack, but if he had, it is almost certain the rest of the Union army would have been routed, and the Confederacy would have won Gettysburg. My guess is that Yelov will try to force Ewell to order an attack using mind control. Imagine if the Confederacy had won the Civil War, Falcon? There would be two nations in America, history would be changed radically and we might never exist! This would be revenge enough for Yelov. Let's head for Ewell's HQ and await developments.'

<p>The stream of superheated plasma takes Baal full in the chest. At this, the people around you flee in terror, some screaming that the gods are doing battle in the streets of Tenochtitlan. You maintain the stream of plasma, and it showers over Baal, who roars in rage and pain. Then incredibly, Baal begins to move through the air towards you, slowly but surely moving against the white-hot plasma that splashes like lightning across his chest. Amazed that anything can withstand such energy you are about to run in fear when Baal begins to show signs of strain. The plasma is getting through. The nimbus of yellow energy begins to flicker on and off. Then he drops out of the sky and slams into the floor of the plaza, his impact cracking the stonework. He lies there bellowing in rage as he struggles up, the yellow nimbus slowly re-forming around him. Awed, you realise he is only stunned and you run for Falcon's Wing, noting that your blaster energy pack is completely depleted. You will be unable to use it until you can fit another energy pack in Falcon's Wing. Turn to 285.</p>

<p>A bolt of superheated plasma shoots into the writhing hole of what was Tsu Tsang's chest with a blinding flash, hurling the creature backward. It crashes to the floor and erupts into flames. Threshing wildly about, it roars in pain, bits of flaming flesh popping and spluttering. A leg, still human in form, rolls away twitching. You watch incredulously as six jointed insectoid legs sprout from either side of the leg, cracking outwards to the floor, and the foot mutates, lengthening and splitting open to reveal rows of teeth, forming some kind of malformed crocodile head. Just then the door slams open and the rest of the mining crew, headed by Bragg, come in. They stop horrified at what they see, babbling incoherently. McReady leans away and is violently sick. The crocodile insect scuttles toward you and leaps. You are about to blast it when Bragg fires a laser pistol neatly dissecting it. Both halves hit the floor and begin to inch together, a tentacle whips out joining the two sections. Bragg stands astonished, unable to act. Quickly you bathe it in plasma and it starts to burn. The lab begins to fill with acidic smoke. Turn to 358.</p>

<p>Together you leave the hill. There is a pause in the battle; both sides are tired and the day's fighting is virtually over. You walk past groups of exhausted and wounded men, artillery batteries, field hospitals and so on. It is all very confused as far as you can make out. No one challenges you and soon you are behind Ewell's Command Post, a small building on the outskirts of Gettysburg. Ewell is sitting at its front. He has lost a leg and the stump is obviously paining him. Eventually, a courier on horseback arrives, with orders from General Lee. Both you and Lynx tense expectantly. As soon as General Ewell has read them, your Psychic Awareness tells you that Yelov is exerting his will from inside the house. You both decide to use your Power of Will on Yelov simultaneously. He is taken by surprise, but Yelov recognises that you are with Lynx and his hatred of you gives him added strength of will. He throws your mental attack aside, but Ewell is now unaffected at any rate. Suddenly, Yelov bursts out around the corner of the house. You stand stock still for a moment, a prickly chill of fear running up your spine. As far as you are concerned, the last time you saw Yelov he was dead at your feet. To see him alive like this is disturbing, even though you knew you never really killed him, due to a puzzling time paradox. His cybernetic arm gleams in the falling light as he raises it to smash you, shouting: 'At last Falcon, I'll see you dead!' You must try to dodge the blow. Make an Evasion Roll.</p>

<p>You dart into the lift and press the button for the Mining Control Room. The lift begins to move. Suddenly it shudders for a second but starts to rise upwards quickly again. Then your radio crackles and Bragg's voice comes out of it: 'It's clear in the storage area. How about you, Lieutenant Falcon?' You tell him what's happened, leaving out any mention of the Rack. He replies: 'You fool! You could've been killed!' Before he can go on, Achov's voice cuts in over the radio. 'I've found the suit computer control chips! They were in the main generator room.

<p>You have misjudged how close your pursuers were. You unleash a blast of superheated plasma that virtually vaporises two of them but another slams into you, wielding a wickedly curved dagger. Acting instinctively, you fall backwards underneath him and use your foot to throw him over your head. However, another slashes your arm as you roll to your feet. *Lose 6 Endurance points.* If you are still alive, you despatch him with a swift karate kick, driving him back into those behind him. This gives you enough time to run on. They seem hesitant to follow you now, and soon you have left them behind. A few moments later and they are lost to sight as you turn into the dark, foreboding street where the warehouse containing Falcon's Wing lies. As you approach the entrance four black-robed figures burst from the shadows and charge at you in silence, drawing long wickedly curved daggers as several more step out of buildings behind you, trapping you in the street. Obviously they knew a short cut. Acting instinctively, you hurl yourself, rolling, at the feet of your four assailants, hoping to trip them and run on into the safety of Falcon's Wing.

Then the blubbery mass of the Mother begins to dissolve before your very eyes, seemingly metamorphosing. Seconds later, Baal stands in the Mother's place, bellowing in anger. With a flash of insight, you realise he has been posing as a Cave Mother using his hallucinatory mindpowers, but the two pieces of the Rack, acting together, prevent Baal from using his mental ability. At this, the Nobles order the Warriors to halt and begin trilling agitatedly amongst themselves. They know they have been tricked into rebelling against their rightful Mother and they see Baal as an intruder now. Taking this opportunity, you sprint for the door. However, Baal, furious, screams: 'You have meddled in my plans too often, mortal. Your puny little organisation can never hope to defeat me, Baal, the Lord of Flies!' and the sound echoes around the chamber so that you can almost feel the floor reverberating.

Desperately the creature tries to dodge it, but the rocket homes in and explodes, smearing the powersuit and its contents across the ridge, where it freezes instantly, completely inert. All that is left is a broad red stain, frozen solid. Exhausted you pick yourself up and use your jets to fly back to Falcon's Wing. Turn to 100.</p>

<p>A day later you leave Falcon's Wing in the hope of finding an alternative to the Winged Demon. Carefully examining the quayside, you are pleased to see that the Winged Demon has left and that another ship is moored at the harbour. You are still some way from it when your Psychic Awareness picks up the presence of somebody nearby. You are prepared when three sailors run out at you from behind a large crate, long daggers in their hands. One of them hisses, 'May Baal, Lord of Flies, have your soul Time Traveller!' You contain your shocked surprise and prepare to defend yourself. It seems Baal has managed to establish some kind of priesthood on this planet, perhaps the very religion that caused their exile from Ascension. As Baal can travel at will through time he will have had the opportunity to do it. Will you:</p>

<p>You must try to get through the door. You are edging around the edge of the cavern when you Psychic Awareness tells you that someone with mental powers has detected your mind. Then a powerful mind attacks yours. You recognise the mental power of Baal. Somehow he is the Mother. The attack is extremely powerful but the piece of the Rack you are holding pulses, draining his attack of much of its strength. Once again you are locked in a deadly battle of wills with the cosmic being known as Baal, Make a Power of Will Roll.</p>

<p>You point the pencil key at the door and it slides open. You jet into the asteroid. Your battlesuit analyses the air, it will bear human life, but not for long as it contains toxic substances. You find yourself in a well lit corridor of polished steel, thirty foot square, curving away round a corner. The corridor stretches ahead for what seems like an eternity. Then you can see a darker patch at its end. You shoot out, to find yourself flying near the ceiling of an enormous pillared vault. All around you at ceiling level is a circle of dark niches, their contents indeterminable. There is an echoing roar of rage and you look down. There, seated on an enormous throne, cut from a single gigantic diamond over thirty feet in size is the powerfully muscled form of Baal. 'Curse you, mortal, will you plague me forever!' he screams. Then he notices that you are holding the Rack. It is throbbing with an incredibly bright light, so that it is painful to look on. For the first time, you see fear on Baal's face. 'No!' he screams. He tries to hurl a yellow fireball and he tries to exert his mental power, but he cannot do either. Then he tries to fly up to you, but he cannot even do that. His face contorts with effort as he tries to travel in time but to no avail. The Rack is preventing all his powers from working. Quickly he bellows, 'Kill him!' From either side of you giant flying creatures burst out of the small niches, filling the air with a deafening humming. You recognise the fly-like creatures, similar to the one you fought on Dustbowl. Will you:</p>

<p>Concentrating hard, you project the force of your will into the mind of the fly being. Its mind is a confusing swirl of alien thought patterns, so different that it almost unhinges your mind. However, it seems the creature is under some other kind of control, nothing like the mental domination you are familiar with, rather some kind of binding that has been upon the fly being for centuries beyond reckoning, something which you are unable to affect. Then its mind invades yours, as its physical body settles upon you. The combination of the sight of the enormous insectoid head, a greenish proboscis, dripping saliva and digestive juices, reeking of decay, descending towards you and the mental union with a creature whose mind is unutterably alien, sends you stark raving mad and you are unable to feel as it slowly sucks your body dry.</p>

<p>You split up at the junction wishing each other good luck. You move on down the centremost tunnel cautiously, your flamethrower at the ready. You come to the Mining Control Centre, scanning it carefully. It is deserted. You cross it to the lift to the mines. You pass your hand over a small beam of light, and the lift door slides open. You step back, but it is empty. You walk in and the door closes noiselessly behind you. Disregarding Bragg's warning in your quest for the final segment of the Rack, you select the lowest level and the lift begins to drop with gut wrenching speed, and after a few minutes it comes to a stop.

<p>You wait until the lights have dimmed and a blanket of silence has fallen over the Dome, save for the quiet thrum of the generators. You creep up the corridor. Light seeps out from around Achov's door. He is still up. As you pass his room you hear a faint sound, as if of a muffled shriek from far away and a soft squelching sound. Suppressing your curiosity, you come to the lab and, opening the door, you glide in silently. You turn on a lamp and search the lab in the dim light. To your consternation you cannot find the Rack segment anywhere, but you do find the egg. It has split open and a thick reddish mucus has spread from it, dripping onto the floor of the lab with a slow, rhythmic splatter. You stare at it, fascinated, for several long seconds. Suddenly there is a sound behind you and you spin to face it. At the doorway stands Tsu Tsang, looking at you sideways, head cocked oddly, the light green pinpricks in her eyes. Her posture is rather stiff and jerky and an eerie shiver goes up your spine. She seems unnatural in some way. She steps towards you. Make a Chance Roll.</p>

<p>You see the ship moored at the harbour is the Dustskate. You walk up the gangplank. A sailor, supposedly on watch, is snoring loudly, sitting with his back to one of the harpoon guns. The Dustskate carries two on port and starboard. Gently you wake him and ask for the captain. Irritably, he points the way to his cabin and goes back to sleep. Knocking on the door and entering, you see a burly red-bearded man, going to fat, his feet upon the desk, talking to another man he calls the Bo'sun. 'What can I do for you, Offworlder?' he says. You explain to him your intention to hire Dustskate for a scientific expedition and the details of your fictitious corporation. He nods, turning to the Bo'sun he says, These Offworlders are quite mad of course, but their money is good, eh? Sure we'll take you. 2,000 placs now, 5,000 when we return. Deal?' You pay him the money and he arranges for your 'diving bell' to be loaded aboard. He introduces himself as Captain Cresap Ord, and soon the Dustskate is under way, its great sails unfurled, skudding out across the Sea of Dust. You notice one or two of the men eyeing you strangely, and you resolve to be on your guard. You are shown to your cabin, a functional steel room with one low bunk against the far wall.

<p>Some hours later, you are rested and sitting in Jobanque's office, relating the story of your mission to your Section Chief. When you have finished he says: 'A remarkable tale, Falcon. You are indeed our most resourceful agent. Once again, the Federation indeed all the peoples of the known universe - owe their freedom to you. Who knows what crimes Baal would have perpetrated in his lust for ultimate power! The Cavers have had some unfortunate changes in their past, but they know you prevented the situation from getting worse. Much worse. The government of Cave, that is to say, the reigning Mother, has sent her personal thanks to you. However, not all the news is good. Agent Lynx is in hospital; she was on Yelov's trail, but he got the better of her. He's still at large somewhere, but keeping very quiet. Anyway, go and have some rest now Falcon, you've earned it!' A few days later, you receive a message asking you to go and see Jobanque again. When you arrive, you can see maintenance men going in and out of his office. Going in you can see it is being cleared out.</p>
<p>Jobanque is standing behind his desk, directing operations. Seeing you he says, 'Falcon, good to see you.' He pauses for a moment, smiling at you'. Then he says, 'I've been kicked upstairs, Falcon. They've selected me to be the Earther Lord of TIME, along with Silvermane, Pilota and R1llk of the Keladi! I've also got something for you, Falcon,' and he hands you a sheet of paper. It is an official TIME document. Your heart leaps as you realise you have been promoted to Section Chief, taking over from Jobanque's position. 'Agents Bloodhound, Lynx, Leopard, Chameleon and the rest are all under your command now, Falcon,' Jobanque says happily. 'Congratulations, Section Chief! Before you go, I've one last surprise for you,' and he opens the door. Standing there, grinning, is Braxton Bragg, looking a little older, but much the same, preserved by life-prolonging drugs. He smiles warmly and grabs your hand, shaking it vigorously.</p>
<p>'Good to see you again, after all these years. Falcon. Jobanque has told me all about it. I've always wondered who you were, a Time Traveller, eh! Never would've guessed it back on Chill in a million years.' You leave the TIME building together. He tells you he owns the Mining Company now and you reminisce about what he calls the 'Old Days' together, That thing certainly gave us a hard time, eh, Falcon.' But, of course, for him it was fifty-eight years ago, whilst for you it has only been a matter of days....</p>
