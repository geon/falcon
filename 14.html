<p>You give your Epsilon Security Code and the micro-display on your wrist lights up. The report on Q's death seems surprisingly brief:</p>
<table>
		<tr><td>Termination Report:</td><td>TIME Special Agent Q Born: 1/9/2890 AD - Lastlanding (Outer Colonies) - Killed on Active Service</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cause of Death:</td><td>Autodoc Malfunction</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mission Brief at time of Death:</td><td>Monitor disturbance in Kelados Timeline 2047 AD</td></tr>
<tr><td>Last Known Action:</td><td>Transmission to Sector Chief Yelov, Security Code Epsilon, interrupted. Subject: Kelados Timeline disturbance.</td></tr>
		</table>
<p>End of Report</p>
<p>Message Ends</p>
<p>To your certain knowledge, there has not been an officially recognised Autodoc malfunction in seventeen years. As you approach the Hall of Honours you realise there is still time to call up Agent Q's last, interrupted, report. You re-open your link with CAIN. Turn to 36.</p>
