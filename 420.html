<p>As soon as you arrive back at the Eiger Vault you hand Yelov over to the head of Security and your mission is completed. You return to TIME Headquarters to be debriefed by your new Section Chief, Jobanque. If you did not send Lord Kirik's Machine into null-space, he sends a team to recover it before it can be discovered in 2710 by the Keladi. On your way to your quarters you are told that Agent Lynx has returned safely to the Eiger Vault. CAIN informs you that there are slight changes to the Timelines as a result of your actions in the past, but that these are too minor to concern TIME.</p>
<p>Two days later you stand once more in the Hall of Honours with Bloodhound and Lynx. Lords Silvermane and Pilota sit at the horseshoe table. Lord Speke is not present, having admitted to Jobanque as a result of the interest in his activities your mission has aroused that he has been breaking the First Law of TIME and living as an ancient Greek for sport. Jobanque tells of your heroic valour and the skill with which you guarded history. He has gathered all of the evidence and tells the Lords what has been happening. 'The Hivers had intended to gain power over the Space Federation. They set out to change the past in Kelados but when this was prevented they went back to change the past in two places on Earth, in the hope that at least one would be successful. Straight after your graduation ceremony they examined the chance of using the mongol Golden Horde to set back civilisation on Earth, before travelling to Kelados in 2710 where they hoped to ensure the outbreak of war between Earth and Kelados. Thwarted by you they then travelled to Karakorum in 1241 AD and kept Ogedai Khan alive, using drugs and the Khan's shamans, whom they controlled, mentally. When you killed Ogedai Khan they tried to change history at the battle of Borodino in 1812 and were then pursued to planet Hel where they, or it, died. The Hiver membership of the Federation has been cancelled, of course. We have used the . Mind Probe on Agidy Yelov: he is the traitor working with the Creche who had promised him great power under their rule. As a Siriun, he would have had an excellent chance of surviving a change in Earth's history and the Hivers were to make him Emperor of Earth. He killed Lord Kirik himself, when Kirik began to come close to finding out what was happening. Indeed, Yelov would not have sent Falcon on this mission at all, if I had not received Agent Q's final transmission while Yelov was away, and insisted that he act without delay! Yelov tricked both Bloodhound and Lynx into believing you, Falcon, were the traitor for a while - his deviousness is such that he even tried to convince you that he was loyal to the Federation right at the last moment by turning on the Creche!'</p>
<p>Silvermane shakes his head and says, 'How is it that Yelov ever came to be head of the Special Agents?'</p>
<p>Jobanque shrugs and says, 'He is a deadly combateer and a clever trickster. Only a very evil man could have escaped detection ...'</p>
<p>'And only an agent of Falcon's talents could have defeated both him and the Renegade Lord,' says Pilota and she asks you to step up to her for the presentation of the Golden Wings, the highest honour the Space Federation can give.</p>
<p>Jobanque says, 'I thank you, Falcon, everybody in the Space Federation owes their lives to you.'</p>
