<p>A white-hot bolt, like lightning, shoots from your blaster, felling Lord Speke. Alexander stares at you in shock, but some of the Macedonians behind you, thinking that you are an evil spirit trying to kill their king, bury their swords in your back. Alexander is slain whilst his attention is on you and you die together. You have failed.</p>
