<p>Suddenly the screen flares as the Phocian Corsair opens fire on the Keladi ship, its lasers piercing the hull of the larger ship which lurches sickeningly. You decide to open fire in order to prevent the death of the envoy, Korakiik, realising that whoever is controlling the Phocian desires war between the Keladi and Earth. You are too late. As your finger moves to the fire button the Corsair rakes the envoy's ship again with its Pulse Lasers. There is a brilliant explosion which fills the scanner screen with light and then you are suddenly engulfed in blackness. You find yourself in a smoke-filled shelter, a fugitive from an alien race on your own world. The past has been changed and your memories with it. You leap out of the shelter to hurl a grenade at a strange alien aircraft on the street above you... As Falcon, Agent of TIME, you have failed.</p>
