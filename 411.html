<p>You fail to dominate the French soldier's will and he glares around the battlefield and then shakes his head. The Renegade Lord has sensed your attack on him, and the full force of that powerful mind is turned against you. You are locked in a battle of wills. It is a battle which you are bound to lose as the Renegade Lord's mind is stronger than yours. All of your being is taken up with the struggle when, abruptly, the attack ceases. You shake your head dizzily, but it is only the lull before the storm. A wave of mental energy flows into you and your brain goes haywire. You seem to feel heat, cold, rain and fire all at once. It is as if you can see all colours at once and myriad voices speak in every language you have ever studied. Your brain overheats, literally burning itself out like a faulty electric motor You are a zombie, incapable of thought, and gurgling like a baby. You have failed.</p>
